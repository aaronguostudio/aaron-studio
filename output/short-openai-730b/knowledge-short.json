Scene 2: golden coins and hundred dollar bills raining down in slow motion against black background. Scene 3: aerial shot of Silicon Valley at sunset, gleaming glass towers reflecting orange light. Scene 4: close-up of a glowing AI neural network pulsing with energy, camera slowly pulling back to reveal it is inside a vault made of gold bars. Photorealistic, dramatic lighting, cool blue and warm gold color palette.",
