## Identity & Positioning

- **Niche:** AI-native execution for product builders
- **Voice:** Builder who ships, not commentator who theorizes
- **Tagline:** "Ship with AI, not about AI"
- **Unique edge:** I actually build the systems I write about (AI Content Studio, OrgNext, DrumNext)

## Content Formats (Know the Difference)

| Format | What It Is | Best For | Reach |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Tweet** | Single post, 1-3 sentences | Hot takes, observations, quick wins | Medium |
| **Thread** | 3-8 connected tweets | Frameworks, breakdowns, stories | Highest |
| **Article** | Long-form native editor on X | Pillar content, evergreen guides | Good (dwell time boost) |
| **Link post** | Tweet with external URL | ❌ Avoid — ~50% reach penalty | Lowest |

---

## The Funnel

```
X (discovery, free value)
    ↓  "link in bio" / reply links
Newsletter — "Ship with AI" on Beehiiv (nurture, owned audience)
    ↓  trust built over weeks/months
Products (monetize: playbooks, consulting, OrgNext)
```

**Rule:** X builds reach. Newsletter builds relationship. Products build revenue.
Never skip the middle step — don't sell to strangers.

## Weekly System: 3-2-1

| Day | Content | Format | Platform | Notes |
|-----|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Mon** | Framework/lesson | Thread (5-8 tweets) | X | Start the week with value |
| **Tue** | Quick insights + replies | 2-3 tweets | X | Engage others' content |
| **Wed** | Blog post + newsletter | Long-form | Blog + Beehiiv | Source of truth content |
| **Thu** | Repurpose Wed's blog | Thread (3-5 tweets) | X | Blog → thread adaptation |
| **Fri** | Quick insights + replies | 2-3 tweets | X | Engage others' content |
| **Sat** | Pillar/evergreen piece | X Article | X | Deep content, Google-indexable |
| **Sun** | Batch create next week | — | — | Use AI Content Studio |

**Daily constants (every day):**
- 30 min reply engagement (see Reply Strategy below)
- Monitor notifications, respond to comments on your posts

## Reply Strategy (The #1 Growth Hack at 0 Followers)

This is the most important section. At your stage, **replying to others will grow you faster than your own posts.**

### Why It Works
- Your reply shows up under a big account's post → their audience sees you
- A great reply gets likes → X shows your profile to those people
- The big account notices you → potential relationship, retweet, collaboration
- Replies are weighted **27x more than likes** in X's algorithm — engaging in replies trains X to show you to more people

### Who to Reply To (Build a Target List)

**Tier 1 — AI/Product Leaders (10K-500K followers):**
Find 15-20 accounts in the AI + product leadership space. People like:
- AI builders sharing workflows
- Product leaders writing about execution
- Solopreneurs building in public
- AI tool creators and reviewers

**Tier 2 — Peers (1K-10K followers):**
Find 10-15 accounts at a similar stage. These become your network — they'll engage back.

### How to Reply (Quality > Quantity)

**DO:**
- Add a new insight or angle they didn't cover
- Share a personal experience that reinforces their point
- Respectfully disagree with a reason
- Ask a genuinely thoughtful question
- "I tried this and here's what happened..."

**DON'T:**
- "Great post!" (zero value, looks desperate)
- Just restate what they said
- Drop your link unprompted
- Reply to everything — be selective

**Examples of great replies:**

> *Their post:* "AI is changing how product teams work"
> *Bad reply:* "So true! 🔥"
> *Good reply:* "We shifted our entire sprint planning to AI-assisted specs 3 months ago. Biggest surprise: the junior PMs adapted faster than seniors. The skill gap isn't technical — it's willingness to let go of the old process."

> *Their post:* "Here's my content creation workflow"
> *Good reply:* "I built something similar but added a step — AI generates platform-specific versions (X thread, LinkedIn, newsletter) from one source doc. Cuts my content time from 8hrs/week to 2hrs. Happy to share the architecture."

### The 30-Minute Daily Routine

1. **First 10 min:** Check your target list. Find 2-3 posts worth replying to.
2. **Next 15 min:** Write thoughtful replies (2-4 sentences each, not one-liners).
3. **Last 5 min:** Check your own notifications, respond to comments on your posts.

**Track your target accounts in a simple list. Rotate through them so you're not always replying to the same 3 people.**

## Content Rules

1. **Never post a naked link.** Always create native content first. Link goes in a reply.
2. **Every thread must stand alone.** If nobody clicks the blog link, they still got value.
3. **Hook in the first tweet.** You have 1 second to stop the scroll. Lead with outcome or surprise.
4. **End threads with a CTA.** Rotate between: follow, newsletter, reply/engage.
5. **One idea per thread.** Don't try to cover everything. Go deep on one thing.
6. **Use "I" not "you should."** Share what you did, not what others should do. It's more authentic and less preachy.
7. **Include a visual when possible.** Screenshots, diagrams, before/after — images boost engagement.

### Hook Formulas That Work
- "I [did surprising thing]. Here's what happened:"
- "Most [role] get [topic] wrong. Here's why:"
- "[Number] lessons from [specific experience]:"
- "I spent [time] building [thing]. Here's the breakdown:"
- "Stop [common mistake]. Do this instead:"

## Publishing Timeline (Per Content Piece)

### The Relationship Between Platforms

```
Blog post (source of truth — owns SEO + email capture)
    ↑ links here
X Thread (discovery, reach — gives standalone value, links to blog in reply)

X Article (separate native content for X algorithm — different angle, NOT a copy of blog)

Newsletter (delivers blog teaser to inboxes — links back to blog)
```

**Analogy:**
- Blog = the restaurant (destination, you own it)
- X Thread = the food truck giving out free samples (drives people to the restaurant)
- X Article = a pop-up at a different location (feeds X's algorithm, builds authority)
- Newsletter = home delivery for regulars (owned relationship)

### Day-by-Day Timeline

**Wednesday — Launch Day**

| Time | Action | Platform | Details |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Morning | Publish blog post | aaronguo.com | Full deep version. Source of truth. |
| Morning | Send newsletter | Beehiiv | Teaser paragraph + "Read the full post →" link to blog |
| Within hours | Post X thread | X | 5-8 tweets, standalone value. NO link in main thread. |
| Right after | Reply to your own thread | X | "Full deep dive → [blog link]" in a reply (not the thread itself) |

**Thursday-Friday — Drip**

| Time | Action | Platform | Details |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Thu or Fri | Standalone tweet | X | Pull ONE insight + screenshot/image from the post |

**Saturday — Pillar Content (optional, not every week)**

| Time | Action | Platform | Details |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Saturday | X Article | X | NOT a copy of the blog post. Different angle, expanded take, or companion piece on the same topic |

### Where Each Format Links

| Format | Links to | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **X Thread** | Blog (in reply, not main thread) | Drive traffic to your site where newsletter captures emails |
| **X Article** | Nowhere (or blog in closing) | Native content for X algorithm — keep people on X |
| **Newsletter** | Blog | Drives traffic to your site, reinforces the URL |
| **LinkedIn post** | Blog | Same as thread — drive traffic to owned platform |
| **Blog post** | Newsletter signup CTA | Capture the reader's email |

### Key Rules
- Thread ALWAYS links to **blog**, never to X Article
- X Article is a **separate piece** — not a duplicate
- Newsletter teaser is short — make them click through to the blog
- Blog post always ends with newsletter signup CTA

---

## Blog → X Repurposing Workflow

When a blog post goes live on aaronguo.com:

1. **Same day:** Post X thread (standalone value, 5-8 tweets)
   - Tweet 1: Hook (the most surprising insight from the post)
   - Tweets 2-5: Key frameworks/points (each tweet = one idea)
   - Tweet 6: CTA ("I wrote the full breakdown" — link in reply to thread)
2. **Same day:** Newsletter goes out via Beehiiv (teaser + link to full post)
3. **2-3 days later:** Pull a single insight from the post → standalone tweet with an image/screenshot
4. **Following Saturday:** If the topic is evergreen, write an X Article with a different angle or deeper expansion (NOT a copy)

**What the AI Content Studio should output per blog post:**
- X thread (primary distribution — links to blog in reply)
- X standalone tweet (secondary, 2-3 days later)
- Newsletter issue (teaser + link to blog)
- LinkedIn post (adapt for that audience — links to blog)
- Chinese version (for Chinese tech community)
