# Video Idea: Vibe Coding is Dead. Agentic Engineering is Here.

## Selected Idea

**Hook:** In 2025 we vibed. In 2026 we orchestrate. The shift from casual AI coding to systematic agentic engineering.

**Why now:** "Agentic engineering" is the new buzzword replacing "vibe coding" (2025's word of the year). Anthropic just released a 2026 Agentic Coding Trends Report. Multi-agent systems are going live in production. The role of developers is transforming from writing code to orchestrating AI agents.

**Your angle:** Builder who ships — literally built a multi-agent pipeline that scouts trends, writes scripts, generates videos, and publishes to YouTube. This is agentic engineering in action.

**Competition:** Low — the term is so new that video content is sparse.

**Estimated length:** 2-3 minutes

## Research Context

### Trend Signals
- "Agentic engineering" emerging as successor to "vibe coding" (2025 word of the year)
- Anthropic released 2026 Agentic Coding Trends Report
- Fortune: "OpenAI and Anthropic spark coding revolution as developers abandon traditional programming"
- Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex launched within 20 minutes of each other (Feb 5, 2026)
- Boris Cherny (head of Claude Code) hasn't written code in 2+ months
- 70-90% of Anthropic's code is now AI-generated
- Multi-agent systems entering production environments in 2026
- Developers becoming "AI orchestrators" — directing agents, validating results, making strategic decisions
- "Tiny teams" (1-3 people + AI) building what used to require large teams

## Other Ideas Considered

### Idea 1: The AI Coding War Just Exploded (Score: 95)
Claude Opus 4.6 vs GPT-5.3 Codex launched 20 minutes apart. High signal but crowded.

### Idea 3: I Let AI Agents Run My YouTube Channel (Score: 85)
Meta video about this pipeline. Strong but better as a follow-up once the channel has some traction.

### Idea 4: Why Replacing Developers with AI is Going Horribly Wrong (Score: 82)
Hot debate but very crowded. Better as a future video with more personal data.
