# Video Script: Vibe Coding is Dead. Agentic Engineering is Here.

**Length:** 2-3 minutes  |  **Style:** News/Trends Recap  |  **Aspect ratio:** 16:9

## [SCENE 01: Hook — 6s]

**Video prompt:** A glowing neon sign saying "VIBE CODING" flickering and going dark, then a new sign lighting up saying "AGENTIC ENGINEERING" in clean modern blue light, dark moody background with subtle tech particles floating, cinematic wide shot.

**Motion:** Static with flicker animation

**Narration:**
In 2025, we vibed. In 2026, we orchestrate. Vibe coding is dead. Welcome to agentic engineering.

## [SCENE 02: What Was Vibe Coding — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A developer casually chatting with an AI chatbot on a laptop screen, cozy home office with warm lighting, coffee cup nearby, relaxed atmosphere, the screen shows colorful code being generated, soft focus background, photorealistic cinematic style.

**Motion:** Slow push-in toward the screen

**Narration:**
Vibe coding was the word of the year in 2025. You described what you wanted. AI wrote the code. It was fast, fun, and honestly pretty fragile.

---

## [SCENE 03: The Problem — 7s]

**Video prompt:** A chaotic desk covered with error messages, red warning lights, broken code on multiple screens, papers scattered everywhere, dramatic red and orange lighting, overhead camera angle looking down at the mess, cinematic tension.

**Motion:** Slow zoom out revealing the chaos

**Narration:**
But here is the thing. Forty-five percent of AI generated code has security vulnerabilities. Companies that went all in on vibe coding hit a wall.

## [SCENE 04: The Shift — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A futuristic command center with multiple holographic screens showing different AI agents working in parallel, a person standing at the center directing the workflow with hand gestures, blue and purple ambient lighting, wide establishing shot, sci-fi but grounded aesthetic.

**Motion:** Slow orbit around the command center

**Narration:**
So the industry evolved. Agentic engineering is the new standard. Instead of casually chatting with one AI, you are now orchestrating multiple agents that plan, execute, and validate work systematically.

## [SCENE 05: The Evidence — 7s]

**Video prompt:** Split screen showing Anthropic logo on the left and OpenAI logo on the right, both glowing and pulsing, with a versus symbol in the center, dramatic lighting, dark background with subtle circuit board patterns, clean corporate tech aesthetic.

**Motion:** Static with subtle pulse

**Text overlay:** "Claude Opus 4.6 vs GPT-5.3 Codex — Released 20 minutes apart"

**Narration:**
On February fifth, Anthropic and OpenAI released their most powerful coding models within twenty minutes of each other. The race is on.

---

## [SCENE 06: The Numbers — 7s]

**Video prompt:** A cinematic visualization of data flowing upward like a waterfall of glowing numbers and code, transitioning from chaotic streams at the bottom to organized structured pipelines at the top, dark background with electric blue data streams, abstract and beautiful.

**Motion:** Slow tilt upward following the data flow

**Text overlay:** "70-90% of Anthropic's code is now AI-generated"

**Narration:**
Seventy to ninety percent of Anthropic's own code is now AI generated. The head of Claude Code says he has not written code in over two months. This is not hype. This is production.

---

## [SCENE 07: What It Means For You — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A single developer sitting at a clean minimal desk with three floating holographic screens, each showing a different AI agent completing a different task, the developer calmly reviewing and directing, warm golden morning light streaming through a window, peaceful and empowering atmosphere.

**Motion:** Slow push-in toward the developer

**Narration:**
For builders, this means your role is changing. You are not writing code anymore. You are the architect. You direct agents, validate their output, and make the strategic calls. One person with the right agents can now build what used to take a team of ten.

---

## [SCENE 08: Call to Action — 5s]

**Video prompt:** A clean modern workspace with a laptop showing a terminal with AI agents running, camera pulls back to reveal a window with a bright sunrise, optimistic and forward-looking mood, warm golden and blue tones blending, cinematic shallow depth of field.

**Motion:** Slow pull-back revealing the sunrise

**Narration:**
The question is not whether to adopt agentic engineering. It is how fast you can make the shift. Follow for more on building with AI.

## Production Notes

- **Music:** Ambient electronic, building tension through scenes 1-4, resolving to optimistic in scenes 7-8
- **Color grade:** Cool blue/purple for tech scenes, warm golden for empowering moments
- **Pacing:** Quick transitions (scenes are 5-8s each), keep energy high for news recap format
- **Thumbnail concept:** Split image — left side showing chaotic "vibe coding" (messy, colorful), right side showing clean "agentic engineering" (structured, blue). Bold text: "VIBE CODING IS DEAD"
- **Title options:**
  1. Vibe Coding is Dead. Here's What Replaced It.
  2. The AI Coding Shift No One is Talking About
  3. From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering (2026)
- **Description draft:**
  In 2025, vibe coding changed everything. In 2026, it's already obsolete. Agentic engineering — where developers orchestrate multiple AI agents instead of chatting with one — is now the professional standard. Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex just launched within 20 minutes of each other. 70-90% of Anthropic's code is AI-generated. Here's what this means for you.
