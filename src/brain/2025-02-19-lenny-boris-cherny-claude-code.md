## 🧵 9 Takeaways for Builders

Fun surprise from this episode: Boris is a big Liu Cixin fan. He loved the Three-Body Problem Netflix series and says he actually prefers Cixin's short stories — especially *The Wandering Earth* collection. His take: Chinese sci-fi offers a fundamentally different lens than Western sci-fi, and reading it shaped how he thinks about the future we're building.

### 1/ Coding is largely solved.

Boris hasn't edited a single line of code by hand since November. He ships 10-30 PRs a day, all written by Claude Code. The next frontier isn't writing code — it's deciding what to build.

### 2/ Build for the model 6 months from now, not today.

Your PMF will feel weak at first. That's the point. Claude Code only wrote 20% of Boris's code early on. The team bet the model would catch up — and it did. When Opus 4 dropped, growth went exponential overnight.

### 3/ Stop putting the model in a box.

Give it tools and a goal. Let it figure out the rest. Rigid workflows and fancy orchestrators give you maybe 10-20% gains — then the next model wipes them out entirely. The bitter lesson: always bet on the more general model.

### 4/ Latent demand is the most powerful product signal.

Watch how users "abuse" your product. People were using Claude Code to grow tomatoes, analyze genomes, and recover wedding photos from corrupted drives. That's how Co-work was born. Same playbook behind Facebook Marketplace — 40% of group posts were people buying and selling.

### 5/ Underfund on purpose.

Fewer people = more AI leverage. Anthropic grew the team ~4x but saw 200% productivity gain per engineer. Co-work was built in 10 days. Constraints force your best people to let AI do the heavy lifting.

### 6/ Give your team unlimited tokens. Optimize later.

Cheaper models often burn more tokens to finish the same task. Let people experiment with the best model first. Find the idea that works, then figure out cost.

### 7/ The title "Software Engineer" is fading.

Boris predicts it gets replaced by "Builder" by end of year. At Anthropic, the PM codes, the designer codes, the finance guy codes. The lines between eng, product, and design are already blurring — and they're not coming back.

### 8/ This is the printing press, not the industrial revolution.

Before Gutenberg, sub-1% of people were literate. Within 200 years, 70%. Coding is going through the same transition — from a specialized craft to a universal capability. No one predicted the Renaissance. We can't predict what universal programming unlocks either.

### 9/ Three practical tips from Boris:

- **Always use the strongest model** (Opus 4.6, max effort). It's actually cheaper in total tokens.
- **Start 80% of tasks in Plan Mode.** Once the plan looks good, let the model one-shot it.
- **Don't limit yourself to the terminal.** Boris now codes equally across terminal, desktop app, and his phone.

## Bonus Notes

- **Boris's Cursor detour:** Left Anthropic for Cursor, came back in 2 weeks. Realized he needs mission-driven work (safety) to be happy — no product excitement substitutes for that.
- **Claude Code origin:** Started as a solo hack called "ClaudCLI", got 2 likes internally. No one thought a terminal-based coding tool would work.
- **4% of all GitHub commits** are now authored by Claude Code. Private repos likely much higher. Predicted to be 20% by end of year.
- **Co-work:** Built in 10 days using Claude Code. Ships a full virtual machine as a sandbox for safety. Boris uses it to pay parking tickets, manage his team's project spreadsheet, and auto-respond to emails.
- **Safety layers at Anthropic:** (1) Mechanistic interpretability — monitoring model neurons, (2) Evals — lab testing, (3) Real-world deployment — release early to study behavior in the wild.
- **Post-AGI plan:** Make miso in rural Japan. 🫘

## Book Recommendations from Boris

- *Functional Programming in Scala* — "single best technical book I've ever read"
- *Accelerando* by Charles Stross — captures the pace of this moment
- *The Wandering Earth* by Liu Cixin — Chinese sci-fi short stories
