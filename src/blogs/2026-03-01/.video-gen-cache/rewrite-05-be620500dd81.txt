Welcome to station one: the sous chef roundtable. 

This spot in the kitchen is pretty unique because it focuses on previous courses. Right in the middle, you’ve got course number four, and around it sit four sous chefs, each keeping an eye on a different aspect of the meal so far. 

First up, Sous Chef A is all about richness. She’s flipping through her notebook, going, “Course one was light, course two was rich, course three was rich...” You get the idea. Then, there’s Sous Chef B, who’s all about texture. She’s like, “Three soft courses in a row? We definitely need something crunchy here!” Next, we’ve got Sous Chef C tracking temperature, while Sous Chef D is handling acidity. 

Each one throws out a question: which previous course really matters for what I’m looking at right now? The earlier courses, in their own way, respond with, “Here’s my profile.” If they seem like a good fit, they pass along all the details. If not? Well, they get left in the dust.

Here’s a fun fact: the sous chefs don’t ever go back to taste old dishes. Crazy, right? From the very first plate they serve, they’ve been jotting everything down in notebooks. With each new course, a fresh page gets added. This way, there’s no need to go back and read everything all over again. It’s like the kitchen’s own memory bank — super efficient, always available, and totally reliable.

Now, what’s the roundtable all about? Its role is to help Ming figure out which parts of the past really matter for the decisions he’s making right now.
