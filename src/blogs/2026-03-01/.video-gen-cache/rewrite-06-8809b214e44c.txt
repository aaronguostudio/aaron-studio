Let’s dive into station two... the back kitchen! 

Here’s where the sous chefs really helped Ming understand the past. Now, it’s his turn to put on his thinking cap and do some problem-solving. 

In the back kitchen, they’ve got a pretty unique way of tackling issues. First off, it’s all about opening wide. Seriously, you want to blow the problem up in your mind, considering every possible angle you can think of—like brainstorming on steroids. Next, you filter out the nonsense. Anything that clearly isn’t going to work? Poof! It gets tossed aside. The good options? They stick around for the next round. Finally, you compress all of that into something manageable... until you land on one solid conclusion. 

So remember, it’s all about opening wide, filtering, and then compressing. Simple enough, right?

Ever thought about how a roundtable and a back kitchen really serve different purposes? The roundtable is all about looking outward — asking, "What does history have to say?" Meanwhile, the back kitchen is a bit more introspective, pondering, "What do I really think about this?" They’re like two sides of a coin, doing totally distinct jobs. But when they come together, they create a verdict that neither could achieve by themselves. 

And what do they end up with? A polished idea of what course five should be, all primed and ready for that final vote!
