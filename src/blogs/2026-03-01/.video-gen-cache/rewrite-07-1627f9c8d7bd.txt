Let’s talk about how the diner rates the meal. 

If Ming was totally sure that the next course should be "a"—and it actually was—great! No penalty there. But... if he thought “a” had just a ten percent chance of being the right choice and it ended up being right? Ouch, that’s a hefty penalty. And if he was feeling super doubtful, like giving "a" only a point-one percent chance? Yeah, that’s a massive penalty.

This penalty? That’s what we call the Loss. The lower that loss, the better the cooking.

Right out of the gate, Ming's score sits at a solid 3.3. Can you believe that? It’s basically what you'd get if you just threw a dart blindfolded at 27 options. I mean, it’s total madness... dishes all over the place, no rhyme or reason. 

The whole training journey has just one goal: knock that number down. Every little tweak, every plate, every single loop — it’s all about pushing that number lower and lower. It’s like their guiding light, their north star, if you will.
