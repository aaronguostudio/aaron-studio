Let’s dive right into it.

Cook. Score. Trace. Adjust. Rinse and repeat. Every dish goes through this same old cycle. But here’s the kicker — who’s making those dial adjustments? It’s not just Ming. Nope, he’s got a secret weapon. Enter Adam, the sensei.

This guy isn’t just about turning every dial equally. Adam’s got brains and a memory like an elephant. He keeps track of the last few rounds. If the last five rounds all screamed “turn down dial 347,” you can bet round six is gonna be a bit bolder. Think of it like a snowball rolling down a hill — it just picks up speed instead of zigzagging around. 

Adam knows when to be gentle with the sensitive dials and when to get a bit rough with the stubborn ones. As they go through the training, his adjustments start off bold and then get super precise as they near the finish line. It’s like he’s tuning a fine instrument, making those final tweaks just right.

You won’t believe this... after whipping up a thousand dishes, Ming’s loss goes from 3.3 to 2.37. But here’s the kicker that really gets me: he never bothered to memorize a single rule! Can you imagine? No one ever said, “Hey, don’t serve three fried courses back-to-back.” And no one explained that miso and rice go together like peanut butter and jelly. He just kept at it, running the loop, and those dials? They found their own groove, reflecting the patterns naturally. 

That’s the essence of learning intuitively, folks. It’s not about memorizing rules — it’s all about repetition.
