This is where the magic really happens.

Ming is constantly grappling with one big question: what’s the next course going to be?

Let’s say the set "emma" is in full swing. The first three courses are on the table, and now course four, another "m," is just coming out of the kitchen. It’s Ming’s call to figure out what course number five is going to be. No pressure, right?

Let’s talk about the three stations you’ll pass through in this course... and trust me, the answer pops out on the other side.

First up, we have the Sous Chef Roundtable. It’s basically the spot where we take a trip down memory lane, reflecting on everything that’s led us to this point. Then, we move on to Station Two — the Back Kitchen. This is where Ming gets to flex his own ideas... he really thinks for himself here. Finally, we hit Station Three — the Final Vote. This is where we break down all 27 possible next courses and rank them by probability. 

And there you have it! That’s the whole engine right there. Just three steps, and everything else? Well, that’s just the details wrapping around these main points.
