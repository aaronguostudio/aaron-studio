Next time you hear someone rambling about how AI is all mysterious and magical, or worse, that it’s gonna take over humanity, just think about Ming.

Picture this: one apprentice, a whole wall of judgment dials staring back at them. Oh, and 32,000 sequences to sift through! No guidelines — just cook, score, trace, and tweak. Do it over and over... and eventually, those dials start to settle down. That’s when intuition kicks in. Taste? It evolves. Pretty wild, right?

Intelligence? Not quite what you think. What we're dealing with here is more like a super-refined statistical intuition — so sharp it feels like a sixth sense.

But you know what really blows my mind? It’s the simplicity of it all. Just six operations, three steps, and one little loop. And from that? You get something that can chat with you, break down concepts, spin a story, and honestly, make it feel like it’s right there with you in the conversation.

Can you believe it? Just two hundred lines of code. Six techniques. One kitchen.

That’s the whole of ChatGPT for you.

No magic tricks, folks. Just Ming.
