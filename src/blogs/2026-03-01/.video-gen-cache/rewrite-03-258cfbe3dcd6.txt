Imagine this: before Ming can really dive into anything, he’s gotta convert food into numbers. 

Take the word "emma" for example. It gets chopped up into little bits — starts with a service bell, then comes e, m, m, a, and wraps up with another bell. Each bit is what we call a token — basically, the tiniest piece of the kitchen puzzle.

Now, here’s where it gets fun. Each token gets assigned a number. Like, e is 4, m is 12, and that service bell? It’s a 26. So the omakase "emma" translates to: 26, 4, 12, 12, 0, 26. Got it? 

But hang on. Just slapping numbers on things isn’t quite enough. A number is like a name tag — it tells you what course it is, but it doesn’t really capture what it’s all about, does it?

Every number has a flavor profile card, kind of like a menu for its characteristics. There are 16 slots detailing things like richness, temperature, texture, and acidity. Now, when training kicks off, these cards are just a jumbled mess — think of it as random noise. But as the training process rolls on... you know, running that loop time and again, those cards transform into something meaningful.

Now, here's the fun part: every word you type into ChatGPT goes through a similar journey. It starts as a word, turns into a token, then becomes a number, and finally gets matched to a flavor profile. That’s how a machine starts to wrap its head around language. Pretty neat, right?
