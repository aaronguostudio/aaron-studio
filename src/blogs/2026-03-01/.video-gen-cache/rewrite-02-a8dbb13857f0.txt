Imagine this: Ming doesn’t have a single recipe in sight. Crazy, right?

What he does have is a mind-boggling 32,000 complete omakase sets, all meticulously jotted down in order. Take "emma," for instance—it's made up of four courses: e, m, m, and a. Or how about "sophia"? That one's got six courses. But here’s the kicker—there are no explanations as to why one course follows another. No flavor descriptions, just a whole lot of sequences.

Now, why is that sequence so crucial? Well, think about it. Serving the same four courses—say, sashimi first and dessert last—totally flips the experience. It’s like that old saying: "dog bites man" and "man bites dog" use the same four words, but they mean something completely different. Direction matters!

Dig into enough sequences, and you know what? Something pretty cool happens: your intuition just kicks in. It’s like you don't even need a manual; the rules just sort of... reveal themselves.

Now, when we look at ChatGPT's version of a portfolio, it’s not just about 32,000 names. Nope! It's the whole internet — think about it: every book, every article, all the conversations, and tons of social media posts — trillions of sequences that get processed in order. Same idea, just on a mind-blowing scale.

Ming? He’s not just memorizing stuff. What he’s really doing is developing his taste. Pretty neat, huh?
