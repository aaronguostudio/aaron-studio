People say ChatGPT is magic. It's not. It's a kitchen apprentice named Ming, a wall of 4,192 judgment dials, and one loop — repeated a thousand times.

Andrej Karpathy (OpenAI co-founder, former Tesla AI head) published a 200-line GPT implementation that I couldn't stop thinking about. It's the clearest proof I've seen that the whole thing — attention, backpropagation, the optimizer — reduces to six cooking operations and three kitchen stations. No more mystery.

4,192 is not a rounded number. It's the exact parameter count in his code. Every dial encodes one tiny piece of learned judgment. They all start random. After 1,000 training dishes, the loss drops from 3.3 to 2.37. No rules were programmed in. The patterns emerged from repetition alone. That's it. That's ChatGPT.

I wrote up the full kitchen — eight chapters, thirteen illustrations — as a guide for anyone curious about what's actually happening when an AI responds. No formulas, no code, just a kitchen and one apprentice who learns by doing.

Which AI concept suddenly made sense once someone explained it the right way? Reply and let me know — I'm curious what the "aha" moment was.
