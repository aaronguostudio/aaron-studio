## Illustration 5
**Position**: After Step 1 "One detail worth noting" paragraph (before the one-liner)
**Purpose**: Make the sous chef roundtable scene vivid — shows attention mechanism as a consultation process
**Visual Content**: Four stylized sous chef figures (A, B, C, D) sitting around a central dish labeled "Course #4: m". Each holds an open notebook. Labels show what each tracks: A = "Richness", B = "Texture", C = "Temperature", D = "Acidity." Curved arrows from each chef toward previous courses shown as small plates. Hand-drawn, warm. Human figures as simplified stylized silhouettes.
**Type Application**: Scene — narrative, character-driven
**Filename**: 05-scene-sous-chef-roundtable.png

## Illustration 6
**Position**: After Step 2 body text (before the one-liner "The roundtable looks outward")
**Purpose**: Visualize the back kitchen's expand-filter-compress method
**Visual Content**: Three-step horizontal process: (1) "Open wide" — a wide fan of many arrows/possibilities spreading outward; (2) "Filter" — many paths with X marks crossed out, some zeroed (ReLU); (3) "Compress" — the remaining paths converge into one clear arrow. Labels show the three words: "Open → Filter → Compress." Clean, minimal.
**Type Application**: Flowchart — three-step process
**Filename**: 06-flowchart-back-kitchen-method.png

## Illustration 7
**Position**: After Chapter 3 "Two Supporting Roles" section (before Chapter 4)
**Purpose**: Visualize the two quiet background actions — palate cleanser and spoonful of original
**Visual Content**: Split into two mini-scenes: Left — "Palate Cleanser (before each station)" shows a simple reset/refresh icon with a neutral palette; Right — "Spoonful of Original (after each station)" shows a ladle adding back a spoonful of original stock into a reduction pot. Simple, hand-drawn, warm. Labels match the article's terms.
**Type Application**: Infographic — two-part supporting concept
**Filename**: 07-infographic-supporting-roles.png

## Illustration 8
**Position**: After Chapter 4 "Starting loss: 3.3" paragraph (before "The entire training process has one mission")
**Purpose**: Make the Loss concept concrete — the penalty system that drives all learning
**Visual Content**: Three horizontal rows showing confidence vs penalty: Row 1: "100% confident → correct answer" with green checkmark and "0 penalty"; Row 2: "10% confident → actual answer" with yellow warning and "Big penalty"; Row 3: "0.1% confident → actual answer" with red X and "Massive penalty." Below: a simple arc/curve showing Loss dropping from 3.3 to 2.37 over 1,000 dishes.
**Type Application**: Infographic — scoring system + curve
**Filename**: 08-infographic-loss-scorecard.png

## Illustration 9
**Position**: After "From Plate to Kitchen" section (before "The Relay / Chain Rule")
**Purpose**: Make backpropagation visually intuitive — the reverse tracing chain
**Visual Content**: A right-to-left reverse chain: [Plate: "Too Salty!"] ← [Plating: "no salt added"] ← [Back Kitchen: "added soy sauce"] ← [Roundtable: "referenced course 2"] ← [Dial #347: "soy sauce intensity"]. Large red arrow pointing leftward. Each station shown as a small hand-drawn station. The chain conveys cause-and-effect tracing.
**Type Application**: Flowchart — reverse causal chain
**Filename**: 09-flowchart-backpropagation-chain.png

## Illustration 10
**Position**: After the Six Basic Techniques table (before "A Concrete Example")
**Purpose**: Make the six kitchen operations visual and memorable — each as a distinct cooking icon
**Visual Content**: A 2×3 grid of six hand-drawn cooking operation icons, each in a small rounded box: (1) Combine (addition) — two ingredients pouring together; (2) Blend (multiplication) — two items amplifying; (3) Reduce (power) — steam rising from concentration; (4) Extract (log) — single drop = big impact; (5) Ferment (exp) — exponential bubbles; (6) Quality Check (ReLU) — good plate passes, bad plate crossed out. Each box has the operation name + kitchen name.
**Type Application**: Infographic — 6-cell icon grid
**Filename**: 10-infographic-six-techniques.png

## Illustration 11
**Position**: After Chapter 6 "That's what 'learning intuition' means." paragraph (before the one-liner)
**Purpose**: Show the training loop cycle and Adam's three methods together
**Visual Content**: A circular loop in the center: Cook → Score → Trace → Adjust → (back to Cook). Around the loop, Adam the Sensei figure stands with three labeled methods: (1) "Memory" — a ball rolling downhill (momentum); (2) "Personalized" — light touch on one dial, heavy on another; (3) "Lighter over time" — large bold adjustment → tiny precise adjustment. Clean, hand-drawn.
**Type Application**: Framework — training loop + Adam's methods
**Filename**: 11-framework-training-loop-adam.png

## Illustration 12
**Position**: After the Temperature section's bullet points (before "ChatGPT runs at around 0.7")
**Purpose**: Make the temperature dial intuitive — a spectrum of risk
**Visual Content**: A single large hand-drawn temperature dial/thermometer with three marked zones: 0.1 (labeled "Ultra-Safe — predictable, solid, a little boring"), 0.7 (labeled "ChatGPT — a little creative, won't go off the rails" with a star marker), 1.5 (labeled "Bold risk-taker — might be brilliant, might be chaos"). Visual outputs shown: a neat predictable sequence vs. creative surprising vs. wild/random.
**Type Application**: Comparison — temperature spectrum dial

## Illustration 13
**Position**: After Chapter 8 comparison table (before "Same kitchen. Wildly different scale.")
**Purpose**: Make the scale difference visceral and memorable — the core takeaway of the whole article
**Visual Content**: Split left-right: LEFT — "Ming (Street Cart)" showing a small MacBook, a simple counter with 4,192 tiny dials, one stove burner, 32,000 scrolls. All hand-drawn, cozy, humble scale. RIGHT — "ChatGPT (Michelin 3-Star)" showing a massive kitchen with hundreds of billions of dials covering the walls, thousands of burners (GPU cluster), trillions of records as an enormous library. Bold label at bottom: "Same cooking principles. Wildly different scale." Human figures as simplified silhouettes.
**Type Application**: Comparison — scale contrast
