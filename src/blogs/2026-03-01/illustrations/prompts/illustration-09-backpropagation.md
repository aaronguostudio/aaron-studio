Backpropagation — Tracing "Too Salty" Back to Dial #347

Layout: Right-to-left horizontal reverse chain.

CHAIN (right to left, 5 stations):
[Plate: "Too Salty! ←"] ← [Plating: "no salt added"] ← [Back Kitchen: "added soy sauce"] ← [Roundtable: "referenced course 2"] ← [Dial #347: "soy sauce intensity"]

Each station shown as a small hand-drawn rounded station box. The leftmost (Dial #347) is highlighted with a bold circle/star burst — this is the SOURCE.

A large bold red arrow runs horizontally under the entire chain pointing LEFT, labeled: "trace backwards →"

A small chef figure at the left end (by the Plate) with a speech bubble: "Too salty!" — this is the starting complaint. Human figure as simplified silhouette.

Small multiplication along the chain: Between Plating and Back Kitchen: "×2". Between Back Kitchen and Roundtable: "×3". Label: "chain rule: multiply at each step"

LABELS: Station names bold. "Dial #347" circled and starred as the root cause. "Too Salty!" in a speech bubble.

COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. Main backward arrow: Red Brown (#A0522D). Station boxes: Light Blue (#7EC8E3). Dial #347 highlight: Soft Orange (#F4A261) starburst. Multiplication labels: Mustard Yellow (#E9C46A). Charcoal outlines and text.

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. Stations connected by sketchy reverse arrows. Starburst/highlight around Dial #347. Chain runs right to left to show reverse direction. Hand-lettered annotations.

Clean composition, chain centered horizontally with white space above and below. Human figure simplified silhouette.

ASPECT: 16:9
