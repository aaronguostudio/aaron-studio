Back Kitchen Method — Open, Filter, Compress

Layout: Left-to-right three-stage horizontal process.

STEPS:
1. "Open Wide" — Left zone: A single input arrow on the left explodes into a fan of 8-10 diverging arrows pointing in many directions, filling a wide space. Label: "consider every direction"
2. "Filter" — Middle zone: Of the 8-10 arrows, most have bold X marks crossing them out. Only 2-3 arrows survive with checkmarks. A small icon of a crossed-out plate (ReLU quality check) in this zone. Label: "zero out what doesn't work"
3. "Compress" — Right zone: The surviving 2-3 arrows converge back into a single bold output arrow pointing right. Label: "refined judgment"

Large step labels above each zone: "① Open Wide", "② Filter", "③ Compress"

Bold connecting separators between zones (hand-drawn vertical dashed lines).

Output arrow at far right labeled: "clear conclusion about course #5"

COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. Input arrow and Open zone: Light Blue (#7EC8E3). X-marks in crossed-out arrows: Red Brown (#A0522D). Surviving arrows: Sage Green (#87A96B). Output arrow: Soft Orange (#F4A261). Charcoal (#2C3E50) labels and outlines.

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. Diverging/converging arrows with sketchy wavy feel. X marks bold and gestural. Step numbers in hand-drawn circles. Dashed zone separators.

Clean composition with generous white space top and bottom. Text large with handwritten-style fonts.

ASPECT: 16:9
