The Diner's Scorecard — Loss and Penalty

Layout: Two zones — upper section shows 3 rows, lower section shows a loss curve.

UPPER ZONE — Three penalty scenarios (3 horizontal rows):
Row 1: Dial/meter showing "100%" → Green checkmark → "Correct answer was 'a'" → Badge: "0 penalty ✓" (green)
Row 2: Dial/meter showing "10%" → Yellow warning triangle → "Correct answer was 'a'" → Badge: "Big penalty ⚠" (yellow/orange)
Row 3: Dial/meter showing "0.1%" → Red X → "Correct answer was 'a'" → Badge: "Massive penalty ✗" (red-brown)

Small label left of each row: "Ming's confidence →"

LOWER ZONE — Loss curve:
A hand-drawn arc/curve on a simple axis: Y-axis labeled "Loss", X-axis labeled "Dishes cooked (0 → 1,000)". The curve descends from "3.3" (left, labeled "random guessing") to "2.37" (right, labeled "learned taste"). Milestones marked: dish #100 (~2.8), #500 (~2.5), #1000 (2.37). The mission statement hand-lettered below: "One mission: get this number down."

DIVIDER: Hand-drawn dashed horizontal line separating the two zones.
