The Sous Chef Roundtable — Four Trackers

FOCAL POINT: A top-down view of a round table. In the center sits a hand-drawn plate labeled "Course #4: m". Four sous chef figures sit at each compass point around the table, each holding an open notebook.

ATMOSPHERE: Focused consultation scene. Each chef figure has a label tag floating beside them showing their dimension.

DETAILS PER CHEF:
- Top (Sous Chef A): Notebook shows "Course 1: light / Course 2: rich / Course 3: rich..." Label: "A — Richness"
- Right (Sous Chef B): Notebook shows "Soft × 3 = crunch next?" Label: "B — Texture"
- Bottom (Sous Chef C): Notebook shows temperature notation. Label: "C — Temperature"
- Left (Sous Chef D): Notebook shows acidity notation. Label: "D — Acidity"

Curved arrows from each chef toward small mini-plates scattered around (representing previous courses 1, 2, 3). The arrows show each chef "consulting" the history.

MOOD: Collaborative, focused, warm. Like a team consulting their records before making a recommendation.

COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. Table in warm wood brown (#A0522D). Plate in Soft Orange (#F4A261). Notebooks in Mustard Yellow (#E9C46A). Chef figures as simplified charcoal silhouettes. Label tags in Light Blue (#7EC8E3). Consultation arrows in sketchy Sage Green (#87A96B).

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. Top-down perspective on the table. Human figures as simplified stylized silhouettes — no detailed faces, just posture and gesture. Notebook details hand-drawn. Small doodle stars near key labels.

Clean composition, table centered, ample white space around the edge. Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes, not photorealistic.

ASPECT: 1:1
