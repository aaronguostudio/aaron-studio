Ming the Apprentice Chef — Hero Scene

FOCAL POINT: A young Asian chef apprentice (Ming) in traditional kitchen whites stands at a clean omakase counter, back slightly turned, facing a massive back wall. The entire back wall is covered floor-to-ceiling with 4,192 small physical dials arranged in a dense grid.

ATMOSPHERE: Warm evening amber light. Japanese minimalist kitchen — single wooden counter, the wall of dials as the dramatic backdrop. A small hand-lettered card on the counter reads "4,192 dials." Quiet and focused, the feeling just before the first guest arrives.

MOOD: Anticipatory, slightly awe-inspiring. The immense dial wall dwarfs the small human figure — scale of judgment vs. one person.

COLOR TEMPERATURE: Warm. Amber/orange overhead light, soft deep shadows on the dial wall.

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn style. Background warm off-white (#FAF8F0). Soft orange accent (#F4A261) for the dials, deep charcoal (#2C3E50) outlines. Color fills slightly outside outlines for hand-painted feel. Tiny doodle details on individual dials (small ticks, numbers). Chef figure as simplified stylized silhouette with slight forward posture.

LABELS: Hand-lettered "4,192 dials" on wall. "Ming" small label near figure.

Clean composition with generous white space at top and sides. Human figure: simplified stylized silhouette, not photorealistic. Text large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts.
