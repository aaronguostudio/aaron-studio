Six Basic Techniques — The Complete Kitchen Toolkit

Layout: 2 rows × 3 columns grid. Each cell is a rounded box with an icon + two labels.

CELLS (left to right, top then bottom):
1. [Top-left] "Combine" (addition) — two liquid streams pouring into one bowl. Label: "Combine (addition)" + small: "pour two things together"
2. [Top-center] "Blend" (multiplication) — two arrows amplifying/multiplying each other. Label: "Blend (multiplication)" + small: "two ingredients amplify each other"
3. [Top-right] "Reduce" (power) — steam rising from a pot as flavor concentrates. Label: "Reduce (power)" + small: "concentrate the flavor"
4. [Bottom-left] "Extract" (log) — a single small drop producing a large flavor wave. Label: "Extract (log)" + small: "a little goes a long way"
5. [Bottom-center] "Ferment" (exp) — exponential bubbles/growth from a tiny starting point. Label: "Ferment (exp)" + small: "exponential growth"
6. [Bottom-right] "Quality Check" (ReLU) — a gate/filter: good plate passes through (green checkmark), bad plate stopped (red X). Label: "Quality Check (ReLU)" + small: "good pass, bad dumped"

Footer note (below grid, centered): "The entire kitchen uses only these six. No seventh."

COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. Cell backgrounds alternate between Mustard Yellow (#E9C46A) and Soft Orange (#F4A261) light washes. Quality Check cell accent: Sage Green for pass, Red Brown for blocked. Charcoal outlines. Icons in charcoal.

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. Grid with slightly wobbly cell borders. Icons simple and iconic — hand-drawn kitchen implements. Cell labels hand-lettered. Grid lines drawn by hand.

Clean composition, 2×3 grid centered with generous margins. Text large and legible.
