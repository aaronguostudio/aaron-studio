Tokenization Pipeline — From Word to Flavor Profile

Layout: Left-to-right pipeline with 4 stages connected by large arrows.

STEPS (left to right):
1. "emma" — handwritten word in quotes, with quotation marks drawn by hand
2. [🛎️ e m m a 🛎️] — six boxes in a row, each containing one letter or bell icon. Arrow pointing right.
3. [26 | 4 | 12 | 12 | 0 | 26] — six boxes with numbers. Small label: "numbers only"
4. One number box (e.g., "4") with a small flavor profile card attached below it, showing 16 tiny slots arranged in a 4×4 grid, some filled in orange/yellow. Label: "16-number flavor profile"

CONNECTIONS: Large bold hand-drawn arrows between each stage. Labels above each arrow: "break apart", "assign numbers", "attach profile"

LABELS: Stage 1: "The word", Stage 2: "Tokens", Stage 3: "Numbers", Stage 4: "Flavor profile card (16 slots)"

COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. Boxes in warm off-white with charcoal outlines. Service bell icon in Mustard Yellow (#E9C46A). Numbers in Soft Orange (#F4A261). Flavor profile card slots filled in Light Blue (#7EC8E3) and Orange. Arrows in charcoal.

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. Slightly imperfect box outlines, hand-lettered labels, sketchy arrows. Small star/dot doodles as decorations.

Clean composition with generous white space above and below. Text large and prominent. Keep minimal.

ASPECT: 16:9
