The Temperature Dial — Risk vs. Predictability

Layout: A large central hand-drawn dial/arc spanning the full width, with three marked positions. Below each position, a visual output example.

CENTER — The Dial:
A large semicircular arc like a speedometer/thermometer, spanning left to right. Three position markers:
- Left position (0.1): Small marker, labeled "0.1"
- Center-left position (0.7): Star marker with a small "ChatGPT ★" tag, labeled "~0.7"
- Right position (1.5): Flame marker, labeled "1.5"
The needle of the dial points to 0.7 (the default).

BELOW THE DIAL — Three output zones:
- Under 0.1: Label "Ultra-Safe" in calm blue. Output preview: a neat predictable sequence of dishes (repeated simple pattern). Descriptor: "predictable · solid · a little boring"
- Under 0.7 (ChatGPT): Label "ChatGPT" with a star. Output preview: varied interesting sequence with occasional surprise. Descriptor: "creative · coherent · won't go off the rails"
- Under 1.5: Label "Bold Risk-Taker" in orange-red. Output preview: chaotic wild sequence. Descriptor: "might be brilliant · might be chaos"

LABELS: "Temperature" as the dial title. Position values (0.1, 0.7, 1.5) large and bold on the arc.

COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. Dial arc gradient: Light Blue (#7EC8E3) on left to Soft Orange (#F4A261) in center to Red Brown (#A0522D) on right. ChatGPT marker in bold charcoal with star. Output zone tints match position colors (light washes).

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. Dial arc slightly wobbly, hand-drawn speedometer style. Position markers as small hand-drawn icons. Output previews as tiny sketchy dish sequences. Labels hand-lettered.

Clean composition with generous white space. Dial centered at top half, output zones below.

ASPECT: 16:9
