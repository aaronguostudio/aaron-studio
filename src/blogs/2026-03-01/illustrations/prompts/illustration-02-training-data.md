Training Data — 32,000 Omakase Records

Layout: Centered with a primary stack on the left and a callout bubble on the right.

ZONES:
- Zone 1 (left, main): A tall stack of hand-drawn scroll/record cylinders. The top scroll is unrolled and laid flat showing a sequence: e → m → m → a with small arrow connectors between each letter. Below it another scroll shows s → o → p → h → i → a. Stack label: "32,000 sequences"
- Zone 2 (right, callout bubble): A dotted-border bubble containing a simplified globe icon and text: "ChatGPT: Trillions of sequences" with a small note "(entire internet)" below
- Zone 3 (bottom center): A small italicized handwritten label: "No recipes. Just sequence."

LABELS: "32,000 omakase records", "e → m → m → a", "ChatGPT: Trillions of sequences"
COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. Scrolls in Mustard Yellow (#E9C46A) with charcoal (#2C3E50) outlines. Bubble border in Soft Orange (#F4A261). Sage Green (#87A96B) for the ChatGPT callout.
STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. Slightly wobbly scroll outlines. Hand-lettered annotations. Connecting arrows with sketchy wavy style.

Clean composition with generous white space. Text large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
