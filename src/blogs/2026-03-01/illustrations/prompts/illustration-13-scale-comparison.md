From Street Cart to Michelin 3-Star — Same Principles, Different Scale

Layout: Left-right split comparison with a thin hand-drawn divider in the center.

LEFT SIDE — "Ming (Street Cart)":
A cozy, small-scale kitchen scene. Key visual elements:
- A small MacBook laptop on a humble wooden counter
- A wall with 4,192 small dials (drawn as a modest grid, maybe 60×70 dials)
- One single burner stove
- A small stack of 32,000 scrolls (humble pile)
- A simplified chef silhouette (Ming) at the counter

Small labels:
- "4,192 dials"
- "32,000 records"
- "1 stove (MacBook)"
- "1 minute training"

Title at top left: "Ming — Street Cart" in hand-lettered warm style.

RIGHT SIDE — "ChatGPT (Michelin 3-Star)":
A vast, monumental kitchen. Key visual elements:
- An enormous wall of dials covering an entire skyscraper-tall surface (conveying "hundreds of billions" — dense grid going to the horizon)
- Thousands of burners/stoves filling a massive floor (GPU cluster)
- An enormous library of scrolls stretching endlessly
- Multiple small chef silhouettes running around (the scale dwarfs individual people)

Small labels:
- "Hundreds of billions of dials"
- "Trillions of sequences"
- "Thousands of GPUs"
- "Months of training"

Title at top right: "ChatGPT — Michelin 3-Star" in hand-lettered style.

DIVIDER: Hand-drawn vertical line in center.

FOOTER (below divider, centered): Bold hand-lettered text: "Same cooking principles. Wildly different scale." with a small underline doodle.

COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. LEFT side: warm Mustard Yellow (#E9C46A) tint. RIGHT side: Light Blue (#7EC8E3) tint suggesting tech scale. Divider in charcoal. Labels in charcoal. Footer text in Soft Orange (#F4A261) highlight.

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. LEFT side cozy/humble style, RIGHT side vast/impressive but still hand-drawn. Human figures as simplified stylized silhouettes — not photorealistic. Dials as tiny sketch marks in grids. Scale contrast is the visual story.

Clean composition. Both sides roughly equal width. Generous margins. Text large with handwritten-style fonts. Human figures: simplified silhouettes.
