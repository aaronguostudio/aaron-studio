Training Loop + Adam the Sensei — How Ming Gets Better

Layout: Central circular loop with three satellite annotations around the outer edges.

CENTER — Circular training loop (clockwise cycle):
Four nodes connected by arrows in a cycle:
① "Cook" → ② "Score" → ③ "Trace" → ④ "Adjust" → back to ① "Cook"
Each node in a small rounded box. Arrows between nodes are bold and sketchy.
Center label inside the circle: "1,000 rounds"

LEFT SIDE — Adam the Sensei figure:
A simplified silhouette of a figure (Adam) standing beside the loop with three radiating annotation branches:

Branch 1 — "Memory (Momentum)": A small ball at the top of a slope, rolling downhill with momentum lines. Label: "remember last rounds → go bolder"

Branch 2 — "Personalized Touch": Two dials side by side — one labeled "sensitive dial: light touch 🤏" (small arrow), one labeled "stubborn dial: crank hard 💪" (large arrow).

Branch 3 — "Lighter Over Time": Two adjustment arrows: a large bold one labeled "early training" and a tiny precise one labeled "close to perfect." Arrow between them pointing right.

Growth hint at bottom right: simple upward curve labeled "3.3 → 2.37"

LABELS: Loop nodes bold. Adam's three methods labeled clearly. Branch connection lines sketchy and wavy.

COLORS: Background #FAF8F0. Loop nodes: Soft Orange (#F4A261). Loop arrows: charcoal. Adam figure: charcoal silhouette. Branch 1: Light Blue (#7EC8E3). Branch 2: Mustard Yellow (#E9C46A). Branch 3: Sage Green (#87A96B). Growth curve: charcoal.

STYLE: Sketch-notes hand-drawn. Circular loop slightly imperfect. Branch lines wavy and hand-drawn. Adam figure as simplified stylized silhouette. Doodle stars near loop center.

Clean composition with generous white space. Human figure: simplified silhouette. Text handwritten-style fonts.
