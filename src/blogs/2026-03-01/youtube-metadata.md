No Magic: How ChatGPT Actually Works, Explained in One Kitchen

---

## Description

People say ChatGPT is magic. It's not. It's a kitchen apprentice named Ming, a wall of 4,192 judgment dials, and one loop — repeated a thousand times.

In this video I break down exactly how ChatGPT works — no formulas, no code, just a kitchen. We follow Ming from his first day as an apprentice (random dials, zero skill) all the way to serving his first real omakase — and by the end, you'll understand tokenization, attention, backpropagation, the loss function, and why ChatGPT hallucinates.

This is based on Andrej Karpathy's 200-line "makemore" implementation — the simplest possible version of the same mechanism behind GPT-4.
