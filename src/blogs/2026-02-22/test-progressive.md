And here's the final reveal with Kahneman's framework. Notice how each image builds on the previous one, creating a progressive disclosure effect.

## [SLIDE: Single Image — 04-two-modes.png]

## Production Notes

- Test video for progressive image reveal feature
- Uses existing images as stand-ins for actual progressive builds
