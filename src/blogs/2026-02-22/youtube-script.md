## [SLIDE: The Productivity Paradox — cover.png]

I've been running five AI agents in parallel. Writing content, generating videos, automating workflows. I was more productive than I've ever been in my life.

Then I hit a wall. Not because AI failed — but because I was using the wrong mode for the wrong task.

This is the part about AI productivity that nobody warns you about.

## [SLIDE: The 10x Trap — 01a-10x-trap.png]

A few weeks ago, I built an AI content pipeline. From a rough idea to a published blog post, illustrations, video, and distribution — all AI-assisted. Multiple agents running simultaneously. One generating images, another drafting copy, a third assembling video.

And the numbers backed it up. A full week of work done in a day and a half. I was a one-person content studio.

But something was off. I was shipping faster, yet I felt more tired — not less. My decision quality was dropping. I was switching between five parallel tasks and none of them got the attention they deserved.

More output. Less clarity. And I'm not the only one.

## [SLIDE: The Research — 02a-research.png]

This month, a UC Berkeley research team published a study that went viral. The finding: AI doesn't reduce work — it intensifies it. Workers who adopted AI didn't work less. They took on a broader scope of tasks, worked at a faster pace, and extended work into more hours of the day.

Harvard Business Review identified three forms of AI work intensification: task expansion — you take on things you used to delegate. Blurred boundaries — you prompt AI during lunch, commute, evenings. And increased multitasking — you manage parallel AI workflows on top of your regular work.

The most striking finding? The most enthusiastic AI adopters are burning out first. Not the skeptics. The believers.

Meanwhile, thousands of CEOs surveyed in early 2026 admitted AI had no measurable impact on their companies' productivity. The Solow paradox — you can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics — is back, repackaged for AI.

The problem isn't the tool. The problem is that we don't have a framework for how to use it.

## [SLIDE: Kahneman's Framework — 03a-kahneman.png]

Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow introduced a framework that explains exactly what's happening.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, automatic. It's how you recognize a face or skim an email. System 2 is slow, deliberate, effortful. It's how you solve a complex problem or make a difficult decision.

Here's the connection: AI is the greatest System 1 accelerator ever built. Drafting, generating, researching, scaffolding — all the parallel, generative tasks that benefit from speed — AI supercharges them.

[IMAGE: 03-kahneman.png]

But System 2 work — deep reasoning, judgment, resolving contradictions, making calls where the answer isn't obvious — that work can't be parallelized. You can't run five deep thoughts simultaneously any more than you can have five serious conversations at the same time.

AI didn't create this tension. It amplified it. And most of us haven't adapted.

## [SLIDE: Scatter vs Laser — 04a-two-modes.png]

After hitting my own wall, I started paying attention to when AI made me better and when it made me worse. The pattern was clear.

I call them Scatter Mode and Laser Mode.

Scatter Mode is parallel, exploratory, and AI-amplified. It's System 1 on steroids. Research multiple directions at once. Generate drafts, variations, options. Run parallel agents on independent tasks. The key word is independent. If the tasks don't depend on each other, scatter them.

[IMAGE: 04-two-modes.png]

Laser Mode is sequential, focused, and human-led. It's System 2, protected from distraction. Debug a subtle layered problem. Make a product architecture decision with competing tradeoffs. Polish a piece of writing until it says exactly what you mean.

[IMAGE: 04b-two-modes.png]

The insight that changed my workflow: the mode matters more than the tool. AI in Scatter Mode — five agents generating options — is a completely different thing from AI in Laser Mode — one focused dialogue solving a hard problem. Same tool. Different cognitive context. Wildly different results.

## [SLIDE: Daily Practice — 05a-daily-practice.png]

Here's how this plays out in my daily work.

Mornings are for Scatter Mode. I start the day with exploratory, generative work. Research across multiple topics. Kick off parallel AI tasks — image generation, draft writing, code scaffolding. This is when I feel like a conductor — orchestrating multiple streams, not executing any one of them deeply.

[IMAGE: 05b-daily-practice.png]

Afternoons are for Laser Mode. I close the parallel streams. One problem. One screen. Sometimes one AI conversation, but often just me and the code. This is where I make the hard calls.

The transition ritual matters. Switching from Scatter to Laser isn't instant. I close tabs, stop background agents, and give myself five minutes to shift gears. Jumping straight from Scatter to Laser is how mistakes happen.

[IMAGE: 05-daily-practice.png]

My rule of thumb: if the task has dependencies or requires judgment between competing tradeoffs — Laser. If it's exploratory, generative, or the subtasks are independent — Scatter.

## [SLIDE: The Constant Is You — 06a-the-constant.png]

In my last video, I said AI is the best amplifier ever built. I still believe that. But now I see a more nuanced picture.

In Scatter Mode, AI amplifies your breadth — how many directions you explore, how many options you generate, how many tasks you run in parallel. In Laser Mode, AI amplifies your depth — the quality of your reasoning, the precision of your output.

[IMAGE: 06-the-constant.png]

But in both modes, the human chooses. You decide when to scatter and when to focus. You decide when breadth serves you and when it's just noise.

The people who will thrive in the AI era aren't the fastest multitaskers or the deepest focusers. They're the ones who can switch between both — who know that the meta-skill isn't using AI, but knowing which mode to be in.

[IMAGE: 06b-the-constant.png]

Kahneman was right. Knowing when to think fast and when to think slow has always been the human edge. AI just raised the stakes.

If this resonated, subscribe — I share honest takes on building with AI every week. No hype, just what I learn by doing.

- **Slides:** Use 6 illustrations + cover as key frames
- **Transitions:** Simple fade between slides, 2-3 seconds
- **Music:** Contemplative/thoughtful ambient, slightly more energetic than last video — this piece has both urgency (burnout) and calm (laser mode)
- **Pacing:** ~1 minute per slide/section
- **CTA:** Subscribe + newsletter link in description
