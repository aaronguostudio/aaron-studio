## Illustration 0 (Cover)

**Position**: Cover image, top of article
**Purpose**: Set the theme — two distinct work modes and the human choosing between them
**Visual Content**: A person standing at a fork in the road. Left path is chaotic and energetic with multiple parallel lines, arrows, and small AI agent icons spreading outward (Scatter Mode). Right path is a single focused beam leading to one deep target (Laser Mode). The person stands calmly in the center, hand on chin, choosing which path to take. Minimalist notion style with clean lines.
**Type Application**: Scene — atmospheric establishing shot for the article's dual-mode framework

## Illustration 1

**Position**: After Section 1 "The 10x Trap"
**Purpose**: Visualize the paradox of more output with less clarity and growing fatigue
**Visual Content**: A person at a desk with 5 screens/windows open, each showing a different AI task running (writing, images, video, code, research). The person's posture shifts from energized (left) to slumped (right) as output piles up around them. A productivity meter on the wall reads "10x" but a clarity meter below it is dropping to red. Papers and outputs are stacking up but becoming messier and more chaotic. Clean notion line art style.
**Type Application**: Scene — narrative showing the disconnect between output and quality

## Illustration 2

**Position**: After Section 2 "The Research Backs It Up"
**Purpose**: Visualize research findings — AI intensifies work rather than reducing it
**Visual Content**: A before/after split. Left side labeled "Expected": a relaxed person with AI robot helper, clock showing fewer hours, balanced workload. Right side labeled "Reality": the same person working intensely with MORE tasks stacked up, clock showing extended hours, AI generating more work to manage. Key data callouts around the edges: "broader scope", "faster pace", "more hours". The AI robot on the right is helpfully handing over MORE tasks instead of fewer.
**Type Application**: Scene — contrasting expectation vs reality with research data

## Illustration 3

**Position**: After Section 3 "Kahneman Had the Answer 15 Years Ago"
**Purpose**: Visualize System 1 (fast) and System 2 (slow) thinking mapped to AI work
**Visual Content**: A brain split into two hemispheres. Left hemisphere (System 1): lightning bolts, multiple fast arrows, an AI chip accelerating everything — drafting, generating, researching icons flying outward at speed. Right hemisphere (System 2): a single deep funnel going inward, a person sitting in contemplation, complex interconnected nodes requiring careful sequential thought. A bridge between them labeled "AI accelerates this →" pointing to System 1, and "Can't parallelize this" pointing to System 2.
**Type Application**: Scene — conceptual visualization of dual thinking systems

## Illustration 4

**Position**: After Section 4 "Two Modes: Scatter and Laser"
**Purpose**: Visualize the two modes framework — the core concept of the article
**Visual Content**: A clear two-panel comparison. Left panel "SCATTER MODE": a conductor figure orchestrating 5 parallel AI agents (shown as small robot helpers) each working on independent tasks — arrows spreading outward in multiple directions, breadth-focused, energetic, exploratory. Icons: research, drafts, variations, code, images. Right panel "LASER MODE": a person sitting alone with one screen, deep in focused thought, a single beam of light illuminating one complex problem. Icons: debugging, architecture, decision-making. Clean divider between panels.
**Type Application**: Scene — side-by-side comparison of the two cognitive modes

## Illustration 5

**Position**: After Section 5 "What I Actually Do"
**Purpose**: Visualize the daily practice — morning Scatter, afternoon Laser, with transition ritual
**Visual Content**: A horizontal timeline of a day. Left section (morning, sunrise icon): Scatter Mode — person as conductor with multiple parallel streams running, tabs open, agents working. Center section: a transition ritual zone shown as a calm buffer — person closing tabs, taking a breath, resetting. Right section (afternoon, focused light): Laser Mode — person deeply focused on one problem, single screen, everything else dimmed. The flow reads left to right like a daily schedule.
**Type Application**: Scene — daily workflow narrative showing temporal structure
**Filename**: 05-daily-practice.png

## Illustration 6

**Position**: After Section 6 "The Constant Is You"
**Purpose**: Visualize that the human is the constant — you choose the mode
**Visual Content**: A person standing confidently in the center with two dials or switches at their sides. Left dial labeled "Breadth" with Scatter Mode icon, right dial labeled "Depth" with Laser Mode icon. The person's hands are on both dials, controlling the balance. Above them, a simple equation: "AI amplifies" with arrows pointing to both breadth and depth, but "You choose" highlighted at the center. Echoes the cover image composition — the human as the constant.
**Type Application**: Scene — the empowering conclusion, human agency at the center
