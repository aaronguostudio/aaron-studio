Research Data: AI Intensifies Work — Scene Illustration

A minimalist hand-drawn split scene. Left side labeled "Expected": a relaxed stick figure person sitting back in a chair, a small robot helper carrying some tasks away, a clock showing "less hours", a balanced and light workload shown as a small neat stack. Right side labeled "Reality": the same person leaning forward intensely, the robot helper is handing them MORE tasks (bigger stack), a clock showing extended hours, additional floating task icons (broader scope, faster pace, more hours) surrounding them. The contrast is clear — expectation of less work vs reality of intensified work.

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn line art. Simple doodle-style with intentional wobble. Stick figures. Clean black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white background (#FFFFFF). Pastel accents: soft yellow (#F9E79F) for the "Expected" side warmth, soft pink (#FADBD8) for the "Reality" side stress. Maximum whitespace. Single-weight line work.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple white background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
