Two Modes: Scatter vs Laser — Scene Illustration

A minimalist hand-drawn two-panel comparison, clearly divided. Left panel labeled "SCATTER MODE": a stick figure conductor with arms spread wide, orchestrating 5 small robot helpers each working on a separate independent task. Multiple arrows spread outward in different directions. Small icons: research, drafts, variations, code, images. Energy and breadth — exploratory feel. Right panel labeled "LASER MODE": a single stick figure sitting alone at one screen, deeply focused. A single beam of concentrated light illuminates one complex problem (shown as interconnected nodes). Everything else is dimmed. Icons: debugging, architecture, decision. A clean vertical divider separates the two panels.

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn line art. Simple doodle-style with intentional wobble. Stick figures. Clean black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white background (#FFFFFF). Pastel accents: soft blue (#A8D4F0) for Scatter elements, soft yellow (#F9E79F) for Laser focused beam. Maximum whitespace. Single-weight line work.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple white background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
