Two Work Modes — Scatter and Laser — Scene Illustration

A minimalist hand-drawn scene of a person standing at a fork in a path. The left path branches into 5 parallel arrows spreading outward, each with a small icon (document, image, video, code, chat) representing parallel AI tasks — labeled "Scatter". The right path is a single focused beam narrowing toward one deep target point — labeled "Laser". The person stands calmly at the center, hand on chin, choosing which way to go.

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn line art. Simple doodle-style with intentional wobble. Stick figure for the person. Clean black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white background (#FFFFFF). Pastel accents used sparingly — soft blue (#A8D4F0) for the Scatter path arrows, soft yellow (#F9E79F) for the Laser beam. Maximum whitespace. Single-weight line work.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple white background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
