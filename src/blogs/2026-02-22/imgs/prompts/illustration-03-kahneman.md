Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 Mapped to AI Work — Scene Illustration

A minimalist hand-drawn scene of a brain viewed from above, divided into two halves. Left half labeled "System 1 — Fast": filled with multiple small arrows radiating outward, lightning bolt icons, an AI chip icon in the center accelerating everything. Small icons flying out: document, image, search, code. An annotation arrow: "AI supercharges this →". Right half labeled "System 2 — Slow": a single deep funnel going inward, a small figure sitting in contemplation, complex interconnected nodes shown as a web requiring careful thought. An annotation: "Can't parallelize this". A clear dividing line runs down the center of the brain.

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn line art. Simple doodle-style with intentional wobble. Clean black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white background (#FFFFFF). Pastel accents: soft blue (#A8D4F0) for System 1 fast elements, soft yellow (#F9E79F) for System 2 deep elements. Maximum whitespace. Single-weight line work.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple white background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
