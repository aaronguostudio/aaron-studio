The Constant Is You — Scene Illustration

A minimalist hand-drawn scene of a person standing confidently in the center, with two large dials at their sides. Left dial labeled "Breadth" with a scatter/spread icon on it. Right dial labeled "Depth" with a laser/focus icon on it. The person's hands rest on both dials, in control. Above the person, text: "AI amplifies" with small arrows pointing to both dials. Below the person, highlighted text: "You choose the mode". The person is the constant, the center of agency. Simple, empowering composition echoing the cover — the human at the crossroads, confidently in control.

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn line art. Simple doodle-style with intentional wobble. Stick figure. Clean black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white background (#FFFFFF). Pastel accents: soft blue (#A8D4F0) for Breadth dial, soft yellow (#F9E79F) for Depth dial. Maximum whitespace. Single-weight line work.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple white background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
