Daily Practice: Scatter Mornings, Laser Afternoons — Scene Illustration

A minimalist hand-drawn horizontal timeline of a day, reading left to right. Left section (sunrise icon, labeled "Morning — Scatter"): a stick figure conductor with multiple parallel streams and tabs open, small robot agents working in parallel. Energy and breadth. Center section (labeled "Transition Ritual"): a calm buffer zone — the person closing tabs, taking a deep breath, a small meditation/reset icon. Dotted lines separate this zone. Right section (afternoon sun icon, labeled "Afternoon — Laser"): the same person sitting focused at one desk with one screen, everything else dimmed and quiet. Deep concentration on a single complex task.

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn line art. Simple doodle-style with intentional wobble. Stick figures. Clean black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white background (#FFFFFF). Pastel accents: soft blue (#A8D4F0) for morning Scatter, soft pink (#FADBD8) for the transition ritual calm, soft yellow (#F9E79F) for afternoon Laser focus. Maximum whitespace. Single-weight line work.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple white background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
