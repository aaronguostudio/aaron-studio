The 10x Trap — More Output, Less Clarity — Scene Illustration

A minimalist hand-drawn scene showing a person at a desk with 5 small screens around them, each showing a running AI task (writing icon, image icon, video icon, code icon, research icon). On the left side the person sits upright and energized. On the right side (same person, showing progression) they slump forward, tired. A stack of outputs grows tall beside them. Two simple gauge meters on the wall: top one labeled "Output" pointing to "10x" in green, bottom one labeled "Clarity" dropping toward red. Papers scattered on the floor.

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn line art. Simple doodle-style with intentional wobble. Stick figure for the person. Clean black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white background (#FFFFFF). Pastel accents: soft pink (#FADBD8) for the declining clarity meter, soft blue (#A8D4F0) for the screens. Maximum whitespace. Single-weight line work.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple white background. Main elements centered.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
