## Title

AI Made Me 10x More Productive. Then I Almost Burned Out.

## Description

```
I ran 5 AI agents in parallel — writing, generating images, building videos, automating workflows. I shipped a week's work in a day and a half. Then I hit a wall.

Not because AI failed. Because I was using the wrong cognitive mode for the wrong task.

In this video, I break down the Scatter vs Laser framework — a practical system for knowing when to go wide with AI and when to go deep. Backed by research from UC Berkeley, Harvard Business Review, and Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
- AI is the greatest System 1 (fast thinking) accelerator ever built
- But System 2 work (deep reasoning, judgment) can't be parallelized
- Scatter Mode: parallel, exploratory, AI-amplified — for independent tasks
- Laser Mode: sequential, focused, human-led — for dependent, judgment-heavy work
- The meta-skill isn't using AI — it's knowing which mode to be in
