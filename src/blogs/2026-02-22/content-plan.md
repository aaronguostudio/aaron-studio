# Content Plan: AI Made Me 10x More Productive. Then I Almost Burned Out.

## Voice Check

**Positioning:** Ship with AI, not about AI — builder who ships, not commentator.
**Voice rule:** Use "I" not "you should." Share what I did, not what others should do.
**This post's personal anchor:** Building AI-powered workflows at work — experiencing both the 10x productivity boost of parallel AI tasks AND the moment when deep, focused human thinking was irreplaceable. A product decision, a debugging session, or a complex workflow design where parallelization broke down.

## Hook / Opening

**Blog hook:** "I've been running 5 AI agents in parallel, shipping content, generating videos, and automating workflows. I was more productive than ever. Then I hit a wall — not because AI failed, but because I was using the wrong mode for the wrong task."

**X post hook:** "I run 5 AI agents in parallel while writing code. Yesterday I spent 4 hours on one problem with zero AI. Both were the right call. Here's the framework I use to decide:"

## Core Argument / Thesis

AI doesn't just change what we can do — it changes how we should think about work itself. The people who thrive aren't the ones who use AI the most. They're the ones who know when to scatter (parallel, exploratory, AI-amplified) and when to laser (deep, focused, human-led). This is Kahneman's System 1 and System 2, upgraded for the AI age.

## Outline

### Section 1: The 10x Trap
- Open with personal story: building AI workflows, running parallel tasks, shipping faster than ever
- The feeling of superhuman productivity — multiple agents working simultaneously
- Then: the subtle signs that something was off. More output, but was it better?
- Bridge: "I'm not alone in this feeling."

### Section 2: The Research Backs It Up
- UC Berkeley study (Feb 2026): AI doesn't reduce work — it intensifies it
- HBR: Workers take on more tasks, multitask more, blur work-life boundaries
- TechCrunch: The most enthusiastic AI adopters burn out first
- The paradox: AI saves time on each task, but you fill that time with MORE tasks
- CEO productivity paradox: thousands of CEOs say AI has had no impact on productivity yet
- Key insight: The problem isn't the tool. It's that we don't have a framework for how to USE it.

### Section 3: Kahneman Had the Answer 15 Years Ago
- Daniel Kahneman's System 1 (fast, intuitive, automatic) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, effortful)
- How this maps to AI work: AI is the ultimate System 1 accelerator — it makes fast work faster
- But System 2 work — deep reasoning, judgment, complex problem-solving — can't be parallelized
- The divergent vs. convergent thinking distinction: brainstorming (scatter) vs. refining (focus)
- Left brain / right brain is a myth, but the underlying intuition is real: different tasks need different cognitive modes

### Section 4: The Two Modes Framework — Scatter and Laser
- **Scatter Mode** (System 1, parallel, AI-amplified):
  - Exploratory research across multiple directions
  - Generating drafts, variations, options
  - Running parallel AI agents for independent tasks
  - Content creation pipeline (blog → video → distribution)
  - Code scaffolding, boilerplate, exploration
  - Best when: the work is generative, independent, and benefits from breadth
- **Laser Mode** (System 2, sequential, human-led):
  - Debugging a subtle, complex bug
  - Making a product architecture decision
  - Polishing a piece of writing to perfection
  - Building a complex workflow with many dependencies
  - Having a difficult conversation with a teammate
  - Best when: the work requires judgment, dependencies, or deep understanding
- The key insight: the MODE matters more than the TOOL. AI in Laser Mode (one focused conversation) is different from AI in Scatter Mode (5 agents in parallel).

### Section 5: What I Actually Do — Practical Rules
- My daily practice: start in Scatter Mode (morning — research, generation, parallel tasks), shift to Laser Mode (afternoon — deep work, refinement, decisions)
- Real examples from product work:
  - [Placeholder: specific product/debugging example where deep focus was essential]
  - [Placeholder: specific parallel AI workflow that saved hours]
- Rule of thumb: If the task has dependencies or requires judgment calls, go Laser. If it's exploratory or generative, go Scatter.
- The transition ritual: how I switch between modes (close tabs, single task, no agents)

### Conclusion: The Constant Is You
- Tie back to last post: AI is an amplifier. In Scatter Mode it amplifies breadth. In Laser Mode it amplifies depth. But YOU choose the mode.
- The people who will thrive aren't the fastest multitaskers or the deepest focusers — they're the ones who can switch between both.
- Kahneman was right: knowing when to think fast and when to think slow is the meta-skill. AI just raised the stakes.
- CTA: "What's your experience? Do you find yourself stuck in one mode? Reply and tell me — I'm genuinely curious."

## Personal Experience Notes

The user's plan.md emphasizes:
- Fast thinking vs slow thinking (Kahneman) as a longstanding human question
- Divergent vs focused thinking, left brain vs right brain
- Some people naturally multitask, others prefer deep focus
- AI amplifies multitaskers — but not everything parallelizes
- Exploratory, research, and creative work → great for parallel AI
- Hard problems, product polish, complex workflow design → require deep sequential focus
- Understanding different AI work modes and applying them to the right scenario is the key skill

Personal examples to weave in:
- Building the AI Content Studio (blog → illustration → video → distribution pipeline) — classic Scatter Mode
- A specific product decision or debugging session at work where parallelization broke down — classic Laser Mode
- The daily practice of switching between modes
- The moment of realization that "more parallel = more productive" isn't always true
