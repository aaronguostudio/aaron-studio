Have you ever thought about how we actually think? Well, Daniel Kahneman's book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, lays it all out for us. 

He breaks it down into two systems. First up, we have System 1 — it’s like your brain on autopilot. Fast, intuitive... you know, the way you instantly recognize a friend’s face or breeze through an email. Then there's System 2, which is a whole different beast. This one's slow, deliberate, and takes some serious brain power. Think of it as your mental calculator for solving tricky problems or making tough choices. 

Now, here’s where it gets really cool: AI is basically the ultimate System 1 booster. It’s like having a supercharged teammate when you need to draft something, generate ideas, or do quick research. All those tasks that need speed? AI just takes them to the next level. Pretty neat, right?

Deep reasoning, judgment, and wrestling with contradictions... that's all System 2 work, right? The kind of thinking where the answers aren’t just sitting there waiting for you. But here's the kicker: you can't tackle multiple deep thoughts at once. It's like trying to have five serious conversations all at the same time. Good luck with that!

Now, AI didn’t exactly invent this problem. Nope, it just cranked it up a notch. And, honestly, a lot of us are still struggling to keep up.
