Not too long ago, I set up this wild AI content pipeline... Picture this: I started with just a rough idea and ended up with a polished blog post, illustrations, a video, and everything distributed — all thanks to AI. I had multiple agents working their magic at the same time. One was cranking out images, another was busy drafting up the copy, and a third was piecing together the video.

And you know what? The results were impressive. I managed to get a whole week of work wrapped up in just a day and a half. It felt like I was running my own one-person content studio!

You know, it was strange. I was cranking out work faster than ever, but instead of feeling energized, I was just... exhausted. My ability to make good decisions was slipping, too. I was juggling five different tasks at once, and honestly? None of them were getting the focus they needed. 

I wasn't alone in this, either. It turns out, more output doesn't always mean better quality.
