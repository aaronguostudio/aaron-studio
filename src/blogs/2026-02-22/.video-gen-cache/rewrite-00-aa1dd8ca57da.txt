You know, I’ve been juggling five AI agents at once... cranking out content, whipping up videos, automating workflows. Honestly, I felt like a productivity machine—like I was on fire!

But then, boom, I hit a wall. And it wasn’t because the AI let me down... Nope. It was simply that I was using the wrong mode for the task at hand.

Funny how no one really talks about this side of AI productivity, right?
