Have you heard about that study from UC Berkeley that everyone's buzzing about? This month, their research team dropped some eye-opening findings. Get this: AI doesn’t cut down on our workload... it actually cranks it up. Those who started using AI didn’t wind up working less at all. Nope, instead, they ended up juggling more tasks, speeding up their pace, and stretching their work hours way beyond the usual. Crazy, right?

Did you know that Harvard Business Review pinpointed three ways AI is ramping up our workloads? First up is task expansion, where we’re picking up tasks we would have normally passed off to someone else. Then there are blurred boundaries — like when you’re chatting with your AI buddy during lunch, on your commute, or even late at night. And let's not forget about increased multitasking, where you’re juggling several AI workflows alongside your usual job.

Here’s the kicker: those who are all in on AI — the super fans — are actually the ones burning out the quickest. It’s not the skeptics who are feeling the heat. Nope, it’s the true believers who are running on empty.

You know, it's pretty wild... in early 2026, a ton of CEOs were surveyed, and guess what? They said AI didn’t really boost their companies' productivity at all. It’s like déjà vu with the Solow paradox — you know, that idea where you see computers everywhere, but the productivity stats just don’t back it up? Well, here we go again, this time with AI.

But here’s the kicker: it’s not the technology that’s the issue. The real problem is that we just haven’t figured out how to use it effectively.
