Remember when I said AI is the ultimate amplifier? I’m still on that train, but now I’ve got a bit more insight.

Let’s break it down: in Scatter Mode, AI really boosts your breadth. Think about it... it’s like having a superpower for exploring tons of different directions at once, generating a mountain of options, and juggling a bunch of tasks like a pro. On the flip side, you’ve got Laser Mode, where AI kicks in to enhance your depth. This is all about sharpening your reasoning and cranking up the precision of what you put out there. Pretty cool, right?

In both scenarios, it all comes down to choice... You get to pick when to spread your attention wide and when to zoom in. It’s all about figuring out when that broad perspective is helpful and when it’s just extra noise in your head.

Now, here's a little secret about thriving in the AI age: it’s not about being the fastest at juggling tasks or the best at laser focus. Nope! It's really about being able to switch gears... Those who truly excel are the ones who understand that the real skill isn’t just using AI, but knowing when to tap into each mode.

Kahneman nailed it. Figuring out when to think fast and when to slow down has always been our superpower as humans. But now, with AI in the mix, the game just got a whole lot more intense.
