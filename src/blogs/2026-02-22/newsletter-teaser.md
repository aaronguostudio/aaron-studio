## Post

I've been running 5 AI agents in parallel — shipping content, generating videos, automating workflows. My output was higher than ever. Then I hit a wall.

Not because AI failed. Because I was using the wrong mode for the wrong task. More output, less clarity. More productivity, more exhaustion. UC Berkeley research confirms it: AI doesn't reduce work — it intensifies it. The most enthusiastic adopters are burning out first.

Kahneman had the answer 15 years ago. Some work needs speed and breadth (System 1). Some needs depth and judgment (System 2). AI supercharges the first kind — but can't parallelize the second. The skill isn't using AI. It's knowing which mode you're in.

I wrote about the framework I use to decide — Scatter Mode vs Laser Mode — with research, personal experience, and practical rules for daily work.
