I run 5 AI agents in parallel while writing code. Yesterday I spent 4 hours on one problem with zero AI. Both were the right call.

Here's the framework I use to decide:

A few weeks ago I built an AI content pipeline — blog posts, videos, images, distribution — all running in parallel. I was shipping faster than ever. A week of work done in a day and a half. It felt like a superpower.

Then I hit a wall. Not because AI failed. Because I was using the wrong mode for the wrong task. More output, less clarity. More productivity, more exhaustion. I was doing everything at once and nothing well.

Turns out I'm not alone. UC Berkeley research from this month found that AI doesn't reduce work — it intensifies it. Workers who adopted AI took on broader tasks, worked faster, and extended work into more hours. The most enthusiastic AI adopters are burning out first. Not the skeptics. The believers.

Daniel Kahneman had the answer 15 years ago. System 1 thinking is fast, intuitive, automatic. System 2 is slow, deliberate, effortful. AI is the greatest System 1 accelerator ever built — it makes fast work faster. But System 2 work — deep reasoning, judgment, resolving contradictions — can't be parallelized. You can't run five deep thoughts simultaneously.

So I started paying attention to when AI made me better and when it made me worse. The pattern was clear:

Scatter Mode — parallel, exploratory, AI-amplified. This is when you want breadth. Research multiple directions at once. Generate drafts, variations, options. Run parallel agents on independent tasks. Scaffold code, explore ideas. The key word is independent.

Laser Mode — sequential, focused, human-led. This is when you need depth. Debug a subtle layered problem. Make a product architecture decision with competing tradeoffs. Polish writing until it says exactly what you mean. One problem, one screen.

The insight that changed my workflow: the mode matters more than the tool. AI in Scatter Mode (five agents generating options) is completely different from AI in Laser Mode (one focused dialogue solving a hard problem). Same tool. Different cognitive context. Wildly different results.

My daily practice: mornings are Scatter Mode — research, generation, parallel tasks. Afternoons are Laser Mode — one problem, deep focus. The transition ritual matters — close tabs, stop agents, five minutes to shift gears. Jumping straight from Scatter to Laser is how mistakes happen.

AI amplifies breadth in Scatter Mode and depth in Laser Mode. But in both modes, you choose. You decide when to scatter and when to focus. The meta-skill isn't using AI — it's knowing which mode to be in.

What's your experience? Do you find yourself stuck in one mode — always scattering or always lasering? Reply — I'm genuinely curious.
