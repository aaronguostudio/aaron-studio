## Title

The Camera Didn't Make Everyone a Spielberg. AI Won't Either.

## Description

```
Scientists tested AI against 100,000 humans on creativity. The headline said AI wins. But the actual data? The top 10% of humans demolished every AI system — not by a little, by a lot.

Every few decades, a new technology promises to democratize creativity. The camera. Auto-Tune. Now AI. And every single time, the same result: the tool got easier, but making something great didn't.

In this video, I break down the recurring pattern of creative democratization, why "AI slop" is flooding the internet, what the research actually says about AI vs. human creativity, and why taste, judgment, and having something to say were always the real bottleneck.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Technology was never the bottleneck for great work — taste, vision, and judgment always were
- AI is the best amplifier ever built: taste in = great output, nothing in = generic content at scale
- "AI slop" was Word of the Year 2025 — up to 33% of YouTube may be AI-generated junk
- AI beats the average human on creativity tests, but the top 10% of humans far outperform every AI system
- The creators who thrive in the AI era aren't the ones who lean on AI hardest — they're the ones who know what they want to say
