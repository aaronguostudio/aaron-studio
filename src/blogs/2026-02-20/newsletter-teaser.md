## Post

I've been using AI to generate blogs, videos, and images for weeks. I love the tool — it's genuinely incredible.

But there's something nobody talks about: making something *good* with AI takes just as much effort as before. The effort just shifted — from execution to judgment, curation, and taste.

The camera didn't make everyone a photographer. Photoshop didn't make everyone a designer. And AI won't make everyone a creator. Technology was never the bottleneck.

"AI slop" was named Word of the Year 2025. The top 10% of humans still demolish AI on creativity tests. This post is about why the human was always the hard part.

I wrote about why — with data, examples from my own work, and the mental model I've landed on after weeks of building with AI.
