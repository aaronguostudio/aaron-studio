The camera didn't make everyone a filmmaker.
Photoshop didn't make everyone a designer.
Auto-Tune didn't make everyone a singer.

AI won't make everyone a creator.

Technology was never the bottleneck. Here's what is:

I've been using AI to generate blogs, videos, and images for weeks. It's incredible for speed. What took a full day now takes hours. That part is real.

But the effort didn't disappear. It shifted — from doing the work to judging the work. Less time on execution. More time on curation, refinement, and creative direction. More time asking: does this actually say something?

The people who show you "I made this in 5 minutes with AI" aren't showing you the 2 hours they spent figuring out what to make, or the 30 iterations they threw away.

"AI slop" was named Word of the Year 2025. Up to 33% of YouTube may be AI-generated junk. Bandcamp banned AI music entirely. 52% of consumers disengage when they sense AI content. The tool got powerful. But without taste and judgment, it just produces noise faster.

They tested AI against 100,000 humans on creativity. The headline: "AI wins." The actual data: AI beats the average. But the top 10% of humans demolished every AI system. The bottleneck was never the tool. It was always the person using it.

The right mental model: AI is an amplifier. If you have taste, vision, and something to say — it makes you 10x. If you don't — it helps you produce generic content at scale. The input determines the output. It always has.

I write about building with AI honestly — no hype, just what I learn by doing. Newsletter link in bio.
