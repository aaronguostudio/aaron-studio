You know, just because we have cameras doesn't mean everyone's suddenly a filmmaker. And Photoshop? Well, it didn’t turn the whole world into graphic designers. Same goes for Auto-Tune — it hasn't made everyone a superstar singer, right?

Now, you might be thinking, "What about AI?" Yeah, it’s not going to turn everyone into a creator either.

I get it — that might sound a bit bold, especially since I’m a daily AI user myself. But stick with me... this trend has been playing out for more than a hundred years!
