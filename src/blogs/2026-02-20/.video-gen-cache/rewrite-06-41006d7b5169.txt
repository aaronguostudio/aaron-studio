Technology evolves... but some things stay the same.

Back in the day of the printing press, the real challenge wasn’t the printing itself, but finding something worth printing. Fast forward to YouTube, and it’s not about uploading — it’s all about creating content that people actually want to watch. Now, in this AI age, the challenge isn’t just generating content; it’s about generating something meaningful.

The creators who will really thrive in this AI-driven world? They’re not the ones who are just cranking the AI lever the hardest. Nope. They’re the ones who have a clear vision of what they want to express and then use AI to enhance that message.

Honestly, AI is like the ultimate creative tool for our time. You should totally use it and make it a part of your creative process. But let’s be real — a tool is only as good as the talent behind it.

Technology never was the problem. It’s your taste, your judgment, your unique perspective — that’s where the real challenge lies. And guess what? That challenge is still very much alive today.
