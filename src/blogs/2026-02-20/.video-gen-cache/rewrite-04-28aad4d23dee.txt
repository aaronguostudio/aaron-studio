Research really shines a light on this whole debate. Scientists conducted a study comparing AI to a whopping 100,000 humans in terms of creativity. The buzzword that made the headlines? "AI beats humans."

But hold on a second. The reality is a bit more nuanced. Sure, AI outperformed the average human. But when it came to the top 10 percent of humans? They wiped the floor with every AI system out there. And I’m talking a significant margin, not just a smidge.

The headline screams "AI beats humans," but the truth is more like "AI beats average performers." That’s a whole different ballgame, wouldn’t you agree?
