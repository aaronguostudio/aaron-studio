Let me share my thoughts with you. I’ve been using AI to whip up blog posts, videos, and images for a few weeks now. It’s not some kind of test run—this is my day-to-day groove.

And wow, AI is really amazing when it comes to speed. I mean, first drafts, variations, visual generation—what used to take me an entire day now gets done in just a few hours. That part? Totally legit.

But here’s the catch that people often overlook: the effort hasn't vanished. It just moved around.

I might spend less time actually creating stuff, but I find myself pouring more energy into curation, refinement, and directing the creative process. It’s all about making choices—what stays, what goes. I’m constantly asking myself: does this actually say anything meaningful?

At the end of the day, the difference between “AI generated this” and “this is genuinely good” is still filled with human touch and insight.
