After weeks of diving deep into AI, I’ve come to a pretty solid conclusion. 

AI is honestly the best amplifier we've ever created. If you’ve got taste, vision, and something meaningful to express, AI can boost your creativity, making you ten times quicker. It takes care of the tedious stuff, letting you focus on the fun, creative decisions.

But here’s the kicker: without taste, vision, or anything to say? AI just cranks out generic content at lightning speed. 

Think about it this way... it’s like a guitar amp. If a talented guitarist plugs in, that amp can make them sound like a rock star filling a massive stadium. But if someone who can’t play plugs in... well, it just makes a lot of noise, doesn’t it? 

In a way, AI hands everyone a camera. Awesome, right? But it doesn’t give everyone an eye for a great shot. It’s like having a fully equipped studio without a song worth recording.
