## Illustration 0 (Cover)

**Position**: Cover image, top of article
**Purpose**: Set the theme — the evolution of creative tools with the human constant
**Visual Content**: A timeline-like scene showing creative tools evolving from left to right (camera, synthesizer, paintbrush, computer, AI chip) with a central human figure silhouette standing constant throughout, hand on chin in thought. Minimalist notion style with clean lines.
**Type Application**: Scene — atmospheric establishing shot for the article's premise

## Illustration 1

**Position**: After Section 1 "The Pattern"
**Purpose**: Visualize the recurring historical pattern of creative tools promising democratization
**Visual Content**: A horizontal progression showing 5 eras: camera (1880s), synthesizer (1960s), desktop computer with Photoshop (1990s), microphone with Auto-Tune (2000s), and AI sparkle icon (2020s). Below each, a simple crowd of stick figures. Above each, the same text bubble: "Now everyone can create!" At the far right, a single figure stands apart, representing the creator who stands out regardless of era.
**Type Application**: Scene with timeline elements — storytelling through visual progression

## Illustration 2

**Position**: After Section 2 "What I Learned Creating with AI"
**Purpose**: Visualize the effort shift from execution to judgment and curation
**Visual Content**: A before/after split scene. Left side labeled "Before AI": a person at a desk surrounded by scattered papers, paintbrushes, tools — doing execution work. Right side labeled "With AI": the same person standing at an easel, but instead of painting, they're curating — examining multiple AI-generated canvases on a wall, holding one up with a discerning eye, discarding others into a bin. The effort is different, not less.
**Type Application**: Scene — narrative comparison showing the shift in creative labor

## Illustration 3

**Position**: After Section 3 "The AI Slop Problem"
**Purpose**: Visualize the flood of generic AI content overwhelming quality
**Visual Content**: A person standing on a small island of quality (labeled with a star or checkmark), surrounded by a rising sea of identical, cookie-cutter content pieces (all the same shape, same color, mass-produced feel). The person holds up their unique work above the flood. Some of the generic pieces are crumbling or dissolving. Conveys that without human taste, AI just creates noise.
**Type Application**: Scene — metaphorical landscape showing quality vs quantity

## Illustration 4

**Position**: After Section 4 "The Hype Machine"
**Purpose**: Visualize the gap between the headline narrative and actual data
**Visual Content**: A split scene with a newspaper/screen on the left showing a bold headline "AI BEATS HUMANS" with excited crowd below it. On the right, the actual data shown as a simple chart: a bell curve of human creativity with AI's score marked in the middle (average zone), while the top 10% of humans are far to the right, clearly ahead. A magnifying glass highlights the gap between the headline and the data.
**Type Application**: Scene — contrasting narrative vs reality

## Illustration 5

**Position**: After Section 5 "AI Is a Power Tool, Not a Magic Wand"
**Purpose**: Visualize AI as an amplifier — input determines output
**Visual Content**: Two parallel paths leading to an amplifier (speaker/amp icon) in the center. Top path: a person with ideas, vision, taste (shown as colorful thought bubbles with stars, lightbulbs) feeds into the amplifier → beautiful, varied, rich output comes out the other side. Bottom path: a person with nothing (empty thought bubble) feeds into the same amplifier → generic, gray, identical copies come out. Same tool, different results.
**Type Application**: Scene — metaphorical diagram showing the amplifier concept
