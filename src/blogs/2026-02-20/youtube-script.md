The camera didn't make everyone a filmmaker. Photoshop didn't make everyone a designer. Auto-Tune didn't make everyone a singer.

And AI? AI won't make everyone a creator.

I know that sounds like a hot take, especially coming from someone who uses AI every single day. But hear me out — because this is a pattern that's been repeating for over a hundred years.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 01 — The Pattern]

Every few decades, a new technology arrives and promises to democratize creativity. The camera. The synthesizer. Desktop publishing. Auto-Tune. And every single time, the same prediction: now anyone can create professional-quality work.

And every single time, the same result: the tool made production easier, but making something *great* didn't get any easier. Because production was never the hard part. The hard part was always having taste, vision, and something worth saying.

Now it's AI's turn. And the prediction is louder than ever.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 02 — My Experience]

So here's my perspective. I've been using AI to generate blog posts, videos, and images for weeks now. Not as an experiment — as my actual workflow.

And AI is genuinely incredible for speed. First drafts, variations, visual generation — things that used to take a full day now take hours. That part of the promise is real.

But here's what nobody talks about: the effort didn't disappear. It shifted.

I spend less time on execution. But I spend *more* time on curation, refinement, and creative direction. More time deciding what to keep and what to throw away. More time asking: does this actually say something?

The gap between "AI generated this" and "this is genuinely good" — that gap is still filled by the human.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 03 — The AI Slop Problem]

And you can see what happens when humans *don't* fill that gap. The term "AI slop" was named Word of the Year 2025. The internet is flooding with low-effort, AI-generated content.

Research suggests up to a third of YouTube's feed may be AI-generated noise. Bandcamp banned AI music entirely. Over half of consumers disengage when they sense content was made by AI.

The problem isn't AI. The problem is people who think the tool is the product. It's not. The tool is just the tool. What makes something great is the person behind it.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 04 — The Data]

And the research backs this up. Scientists tested AI against 100,000 humans on creativity. The headline everyone ran with was "AI beats humans."

But the actual data tells a different story. AI beat the *average* human. The top 10 percent of humans? They demolished every AI system. Not by a little — by a lot.

The headline says "AI beats humans." The data says "AI beats mediocre humans." That's a very different story.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 05 — The Amplifier Mental Model]

So here's the mental model I've landed on after weeks of building with AI.

AI is the best amplifier ever built.

If you have taste, vision, and something to say — AI makes you ten times faster. It handles the grunt work so you can focus on the creative decisions.

But if you don't have taste, vision, or something to say? AI just helps you produce generic content faster.

Think of it like a guitar amplifier. If a great guitarist plugs in, the amplifier makes them fill a stadium. If someone who can't play plugs in, the amplifier just makes the noise louder.

AI gives everyone a camera. It doesn't give everyone an eye. AI gives everyone a studio. It doesn't give everyone a song worth recording.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 06 — The Constant]

Technology changes. The fundamental equation doesn't.

In the age of the printing press, the bottleneck wasn't printing — it was having something worth printing. In the age of YouTube, the bottleneck isn't uploading — it's having something worth watching. In the age of AI, the bottleneck isn't generating — it's having something worth generating.

The creators who will thrive in the AI era aren't the ones who lean on AI the hardest. They're the ones who know what they want to say — and use AI to say it better.

AI is the best creative tool of our generation. Use it. Embrace it. But don't mistake the tool for the talent.

Technology was never the bottleneck. Your taste, your judgment, your perspective — that was always the hard part. It still is.
