Las Vegas Timeshare Experience - Cover Scene

FOCAL POINT: A stylized couple walking down an upscale hotel corridor toward a frosted glass door labeled "Vacation Club Presentation." The corridor transitions from warm golden hospitality lighting on one end to cool sterile fluorescent lighting near the door.

ATMOSPHERE: Dramatic lighting contrast — warm, inviting hotel ambiance (golden tones, elegant decor) gradually shifting to cold, clinical presentation room atmosphere (blue-white light, stark walls).

MOOD: Tension between luxury hospitality and corporate sales pressure. Anticipation mixed with unease.

COLOR TEMPERATURE: Split warm-to-cool gradient. Gold/amber on the left transitioning to steel blue on the right.

STYLE: Editorial magazine illustration style. Bold graphic shapes, clean lines, strong visual narrative. Modern journalistic feel with dramatic composition.

Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered or positioned by content needs.

ASPECT: 16:9
