The Pressure Moment - Narrative Scene

FOCAL POINT: A stylized scene across a desk. On one side, a couple sitting together looking hesitant and uncomfortable. On the other side, a salesperson whose expression has shifted from friendly to cold and disappointed. A large clock on the wall prominently shows "30 MIN" with emphasis.

ATMOSPHERE: Tense office environment. The warm presentation room has turned cold. Papers and brochures scattered on the desk between them. The contrast between the couple's discomfort and the salesperson's displeasure.

MOOD: Uncomfortable pressure, broken trust, the moment hospitality turns into hard selling. The couple wants to leave but feels trapped.

COLOR TEMPERATURE: Cool — previously warm room now feels cold and clinical. Blue-gray tones dominate.

STYLE: Editorial illustration with dramatic tension. Bold graphic style, strong composition emphasizing the divide between the two sides of the desk. Magazine feature story aesthetic.

Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered or positioned by content needs.

ASPECT: 16:9
