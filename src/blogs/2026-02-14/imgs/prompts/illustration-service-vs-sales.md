DIVIDER: A visible crack or gap running vertically between the two sides. A hotel brand logo silhouette sits at the top, straddling both worlds — showing how one company can embody both cultures.

BOTTOM TEXT: "Every touchpoint either builds trust or breaks it."

COLORS: Left warm gold (#D4A843), amber (#F5C869). Right steel blue (#607D8B), cool gray (#B0BEC5). White background. Navy (#2B3A67) for text.
STYLE: Editorial magazine comparison. Dramatic visual contrast between warmth and coldness. Bold graphic shapes, clean professional layout. The crack/gap between sides should be visually prominent.

Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
