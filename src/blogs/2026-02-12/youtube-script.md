## [SLIDE: Cover Image — 00-cover.png]

Hey everyone. I want to talk about something that's been changing how I work every single day.

I've been in tech for a while — building products, writing code, leading teams. I've seen plenty of "next big things" come and go. But this time? This time feels genuinely different.

I'm talking about going AI Native. And today I'm going to share what that means, why I'm doing it, and what I've actually experienced so far.

So what do I mean by AI Native?

For me, it means AI isn't something I bolt on after the fact. It's not a plugin. It's not a fancy autocomplete. It's the starting point.

Every time I sit down to work, AI is already part of my workflow. Writing code? AI is right there. Researching a new domain? AI helps me learn faster. Drafting a product spec? Same thing.

Think about the shift from desktop to mobile-first. Once you go native, you don't go back.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 02 — AI Native vs Traditional]

Look at this comparison. On the left, the traditional way — you have your tools, your processes, and AI sits off to the side as an add-on. You use it sometimes, but it's separate from how you actually think and work.

On the right — AI Native. Everything is connected. AI is woven into the workflow from the start. It's not a separate step, it's how you operate.

That mental shift? That's the key.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 03 — Breakthrough Moment]

Let me tell you about the moment it clicked for me.

I'm a head of products who still codes. I love building things with my own hands. But time is always the bottleneck, right? Between product strategy, team alignment, and actually writing code, there are never enough hours.

A few months ago, I was tackling a project that would normally take me days of focused coding. I decided to go AI-first. Not just autocomplete — actually collaborating with AI through the entire process. Architecture decisions, implementation, debugging, testing.

What used to take days... took hours. And the quality was there. The code was clean. I shipped it with confidence.

That was my moment. I realized — this isn't a productivity hack. It's a fundamental shift in what one person can accomplish.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 04 — Three Benefits]

So let me break down the three biggest changes I've seen.

**Number one: Coding at 2-3x speed.** I'm not exaggerating. When I pair with AI, I spend less time on boilerplate, less time looking up APIs, less time on the boring parts. I get to focus on what matters — the architecture, the user experience, the tradeoffs.

**Number two: Learning new things in hours, not weeks.** As a product leader, I need to understand a wide range of technologies. AI has become my 24/7 learning partner. I can dive into an unfamiliar codebase or a complex concept and get up to speed dramatically faster.

**Number three — and this is the big one: Building things I wouldn't have attempted before.** Projects I would have dismissed as "too much work for one person"? Now I look at them and think — why not? The barrier to building has dropped so much that the limiting factor isn't time or skill anymore. It's imagination.

## [SLIDE: Illustration 05 — Journey Ahead]

So why am I sharing all this?

I'm not here to convince you that AI is the future — you probably already know that. What I want to do is document what it actually looks like to go AI Native as someone who builds products and writes code every day.

There's a lot of hype out there. There's also a lot of skepticism. What's missing is the honest, in-the-trenches perspective. What works? What doesn't?

That's what this series is about. I'm calling it my AI Native Journey, and this is just the beginning. I'll be sharing real projects, real workflows, and real lessons — including the mistakes.

I strongly believe we're at the beginning of something massive. And the people who embrace this shift early will have an enormous advantage.

I'm going all in. Come along for the ride.
