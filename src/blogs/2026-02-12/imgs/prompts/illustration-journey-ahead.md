The Journey Ahead - Scene

A hand-drawn winding path stretching toward a simple sunrise on the horizon. Small hand-drawn milestone markers (flags or pins) along the path. A friendly hand-drawn figure walking forward on the path. Soft rolling hills sketched with loose lines. Warm, inviting, full of possibility.

MOOD: Optimism, adventure, come along for the ride
COLOR TEMPERATURE: Warm neutrals — ink lines on cream, sunrise in soft gold/peach, path with subtle warm tone, hills in soft muted green

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn illustration. Loose ink-like lines with warmth and personality. Rounded shapes, friendly feel. Like a polished whiteboard sketch. Muted earth tones with soft warm accents.

Clean composition with generous white space. Soft cream background. Path and figure in center.
