The Breakthrough Moment - Scene

A hand-drawn figure leaning back in a chair with a satisfied smile, hands behind head. A laptop or monitor in front showing code lines. Above them, a hand-drawn clock with "DAYS" softly crossed out and "HOURS" circled with a warm highlight. Small hand-drawn stars or sparkles around the realization moment.

FOCAL POINT: The relaxed figure with the clock metaphor above
ATMOSPHERE: Cozy, personal, satisfying
MOOD: Quiet triumph, aha moment, confidence
COLOR TEMPERATURE: Warm neutrals — black ink lines, cream background, "HOURS" highlighted in soft teal or warm peach

STYLE: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn illustration. Loose ink-like lines with warmth and personality. Rounded shapes, friendly feel. Like a polished whiteboard sketch. Muted earth tones.

Clean composition with generous white space. Soft cream background. Centered.
Human figures: friendly hand-drawn style, simple but expressive with personality.
