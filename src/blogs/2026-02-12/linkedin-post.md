I stopped using AI as a side tool. I made it the starting point of everything.

The result? What used to take days now takes hours — and the quality is better.

A few months ago, I ran an experiment: AI-first for an entire project. Architecture, implementation, debugging, testing — all with AI as my collaborator, not my assistant.

Since then, I've been going "AI Native." Here's what changed:

→ Coding at 2-3x speed (less boilerplate, more architecture decisions)
→ Learning new domains in hours instead of weeks
→ Building projects I would have dismissed as "too much for one person"

The limiting factor is no longer time or technical skill. It's imagination.

I've seen a lot of "next big things" come and go in my career. But AI is different — it's a fundamental shift in what one person can accomplish.

I'm documenting this journey in a series called "AI Native Journey" — sharing what works, what doesn't, and the real lessons from building with AI every day.
