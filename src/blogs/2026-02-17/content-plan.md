# Content Plan: McKinsey Says 2035. I Say They're Off by 5 Years.

## Hook / Opening

McKinsey just dropped a 10-page report predicting how AI, demographics, and trust will reshape US wealth management by 2035. It's a solid report — well-researched, carefully hedged, consultant-perfect. But I read it differently than most people would, because I'm not a consultant. I'm a Head of Products at a financial firm who still codes every day, and I'm building AI-native systems on the side. The future they're describing? Parts of it are already here.

## Core Argument / Thesis

McKinsey's six themes for 2035 are directionally right, but their timeline is too conservative by about 5 years. The gap between consultant timelines and builder reality is the real story — and firms that plan for 2035 will be disrupted by firms building for 2027.

## Outline

### Section 1: The Report in 60 Seconds
- Quick summary of McKinsey's six themes (don't rehash the full report — respect the reader's time):
  1. Demographic shift — $22T wealth transfer to Gen X/millennials, 40%+ wealth controlled by women, 100K advisor shortfall
  2. Agentic AI — from task automation to systems that reason and act
  3. Asset class expansion — private markets, real assets, digital/tokenized assets
  4. Trust rebuilt through transparency, not institutional reputation
  5. Every client becomes a family office — holistic "life management"
  6. Advisors evolve from planners to life coaches
- Plus four competitive archetypes: mega-platforms, boutiques, independent platforms, AI-native firms
- Link to the original report for readers who want the full thing

### Section 2: Where McKinsey Is Right
- **The advisor shortage is real and urgent**
  - Personal experience: I see this in my own firm — experienced advisors retiring, junior hires taking years to ramp
  - The math doesn't work without AI augmentation
  - McKinsey's 100K shortfall might even be conservative
- **Trust IS shifting with younger clients**
  - 76% of Gen Z seeking financial advice online — aligns with our product data
  - The "show me, don't tell me" dynamic is real in every client interaction
- **The "family office for everyone" trend is happening**
  - Clients already demanding holistic advice — investments + tax + estate + lifestyle
  - Tech is making this possible at lower wealth tiers
  - We're actively building toward this in our product roadmap

### Section 3: Where McKinsey Is Too Conservative
- **Agentic AI is not a 2035 story — it's 2026**
  - I set up an AI agent on a Mac mini this week. It runs 24/7, does deep research, manages content pipelines, runs scheduled tasks autonomously
  - In my day job, we're already using AI to augment product workflows, research, and reporting
  - 62% of advisors "intend to use AI" was 2024 data — the movers have already moved
  - Specific example: what took a research team days now takes my AI agent hours
- **The four archetypes underestimate AI-native disruption**
  - McKinsey's "firm of one" concept (single advisor + hundreds of AI agents) is the real endgame
  - When one person can do what ten did, the economics of every model break — not just the "AI-native" category
  - AI-native isn't a separate category — it's a capability that eats into all categories
- **Portfolio transformation is already shipping**
  - Tokenization, direct indexing, digital assets — these are 2026 products, not 2035 concepts
  - "Unified managed household" platforms exist in early form today

### Section 4: What McKinsey Is Missing
- **The builder vs. buyer divide**
  - Biggest gap won't be between firm types — it'll be between firms that BUILD AI vs. firms that BUY it
  - Same pattern as digital transformation: firms that "bought digital" lost to firms that "became digital"
  - Vendor solutions always lag by a generation
- **The real talent crisis is product + engineering, not just advisors**
  - Who builds the AI systems? Product leaders and engineers who understand BOTH finance AND AI
  - This intersection is incredibly rare — most AI engineers don't understand financial services, most finance people don't understand AI architecture
  - This hybrid talent is the actual bottleneck
- **Client experience will leapfrog, not evolve**
  - McKinsey describes gradual "clicks to conversations" evolution
  - I think it'll be more abrupt — phase change, not gradual improvement
  - When a client can talk to an AI that knows their entire financial picture and gets instant personalized answers, the bar for human advisors jumps overnight

### Section 5: What This Means For You
- **If you're a financial advisor:** Start learning AI tools NOW, not in 2035
- **If you're a product leader at a financial firm:** Push for building, not buying. Every year of delay is a year competitors get ahead
- **If you're a builder/engineer:** Financial services AI is massively under-served. The finance + AI + product intersection is where the biggest opportunities are
- **If you're a client:** Demand more. Ask your wealth manager how they're using AI. "We're exploring it" is a red flag

### Conclusion
- McKinsey's report is a solid map. But maps from consultants underestimate builder speed.
- The firms planning for 2035 will be disrupted by firms building for 2027
- I'm in both worlds — product leader at a financial firm by day, AI-native builder by night — and the future they describe isn't 10 years away. It's 3.
- The question isn't whether you'll adapt. It's whether you'll lead or follow.

## Personal Experience Notes

- Aaron is Head of Products & Partner at a financial firm (investment management)
