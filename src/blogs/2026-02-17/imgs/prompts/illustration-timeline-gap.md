McKinsey Timeline vs Builder Reality - Dual Timeline Comparison

Minimalist hand-drawn line art infographic in Notion style. Clean white background (#FFFFFF).

Layout: Two horizontal timelines stacked vertically, sharing the same starting point on the left (2026), with different endpoints.

TOP TIMELINE — "McKinsey's Map":
- A horizontal arrow from left (labeled "2026" at start) to right (labeled "2035" at end)
- Arrow styled slightly formal and straight
- Label above the arrow: "McKinsey's Map" in hand-drawn lettering
- At the 2035 endpoint: a small flag icon with text "Transformation Complete"
- Arrow color: Slate Gray (#4A4A4A)

BOTTOM TIMELINE — "Builder Reality":
- A horizontal arrow from left (same "2026" start point) to right (labeled "2030" at end)
- Arrow ends noticeably shorter than the top timeline, emphasizing the earlier endpoint
- Label below the arrow: "Builder Reality" in hand-drawn lettering
- At the 2030 endpoint: a small lightning bolt icon with text "Already Happening"
- Arrow color: Soft Blue (#A8D4F0) — slightly bolder to feel more energetic

CENTER GAP INDICATOR:
- A vertical double-headed bracket connecting the two endpoints (2035 vs 2030)
- Bold text "5 years" beside the bracket, handwritten style
- Bracket in Pastel Yellow (#F9E79F) or dark outline

Overall: Both timelines start at the same left point (2026). The top arrow extends further right to 2035. The bottom arrow stops at 2030. The visual gap between the two right endpoints is the focal point.

COLORS: Black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white (#FFFFFF). Slate Gray (#4A4A4A) for McKinsey timeline. Soft Blue (#A8D4F0) for Builder timeline. Pastel Yellow accent for the gap bracket.

STYLE: Hand-drawn wobble effect. Single-weight lines. Maximum whitespace. Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered.
