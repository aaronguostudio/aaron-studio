McKinsey 2035 vs Builder Reality 2030 - Cover Illustration

Minimalist hand-drawn line art infographic in Notion style. Clean white background (#FFFFFF).

Layout: Horizontal split composition, two sides separated by a central gap indicator.

LEFT SIDE — "The Consultant's Map":
A neatly bound report document with clean lines, labeled "2035" in bold at the top. A small magnifying glass or compass icon below it. Label underneath: "McKinsey's timeline". Slightly formal, organized aesthetic.

CENTER — Gap Indicator:
A vertical dashed line dividing the two sides. A horizontal double-headed arrow spanning both sides with "5 years" written above it in hand-drawn lettering. The gap is the visual focal point.

RIGHT SIDE — "Builder Reality":
A simple laptop or terminal screen with a glowing cursor and a few lines of code or agent interface elements. Labeled "2030" at the top. Small robot or lightning bolt icon below. Label underneath: "Builder reality". More dynamic, energized feel.

COLORS: Black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white (#FFFFFF). Soft Blue (#A8D4F0) fill on the left report. Pastel Yellow (#F9E79F) fill on the right screen. Slate Gray (#4A4A4A) for the central gap bracket and arrows. No other colors.

STYLE: Hand-drawn wobble effect on all lines. Single-weight line work. Maximum whitespace. Simple doodle icons — not detailed. Clean hand-drawn lettering for labels. Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered.
