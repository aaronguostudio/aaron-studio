## Illustration 0 (Cover)

**Position**: Cover image (used as blog banner, not in body)
**Purpose**: Set the visual tone — the tension between a formal consultant report and a fast-moving builder's reality
**Visual Content**: Split composition: on the left, a polished bound report labeled "2035" with a formal consultant feel; on the right, a glowing terminal/laptop screen labeled "2030" with code and agent interfaces. A dotted arrow bridge between them showing a 5-year gap. Clean hand-drawn style.
**Type Application**: Comparison — visual metaphor for the consultant vs builder divide

## Illustration 1

**Position**: After "The Report in 60 Seconds" section
**Purpose**: Summarize McKinsey's six themes at a glance — give readers a scannable reference before the analysis
**Visual Content**: A 2×3 grid of 6 numbered boxes, each with a simple doodle icon and a short label. 1) Demographic Shift (family/wealth icon), 2) Agentic AI (robot/agent icon), 3) Asset Expansion (coins/token icon), 4) Trust (handshake/transparency icon), 5) Family Office for All (house icon), 6) Advisor as Life Coach (person + star icon). Clean gridlines, each box lightly shaded in pastel blue or yellow accent.
**Type Application**: Infographic — framework grid

## Illustration 2

**Position**: After "Where McKinsey Is Too Conservative" section
**Purpose**: Make the 5-year gap between McKinsey's timeline and builder reality visually tangible
**Visual Content**: Two horizontal timelines stacked vertically. TOP: labeled "McKinsey's Map" — a clean horizontal arrow from 2026 → 2035, with the label "Transformation complete" at the far right end. BOTTOM: labeled "Builder Reality" — same arrow but ending at 2030 with "Already happening" at right. A vertical bracket between the two endpoints with the text "5 years" highlighting the gap. Both timelines start at the same 2026 point.
**Type Application**: Comparison — dual-timeline with gap annotation

## Illustration 3

**Position**: After "What McKinsey Is Missing" section
**Purpose**: Visualize the "firm of one" concept — one person amplified by many AI agents
**Visual Content**: A central human silhouette (simple stick figure or outline) seated at a desk. Radiating outward from the person via dotted lines: 6–8 small rectangular agent cards, each with a tiny robot icon and a label (Research, Reporting, Portfolio Review, Client Comms, Compliance, Market Analysis). The overall shape resembles a sun or hub-and-spoke. Centered with lots of white space around the hub figure.
**Type Application**: Scene / Framework — the amplified human
