As a product leader, I'm always looking for leverage — ways to get more done without scaling headcount.

Last weekend, I ran an experiment. I set up an AI agent (OpenClaw) on a Mac mini as a persistent, always-on partner for my side projects. Named it GG. Connected it via WhatsApp so I could collaborate the same way I message my team.

Within 48 hours, GG had:
- Analyzed my blog and delivered specific improvement recommendations
- Researched 5 successful creator strategies with actionable takeaways
- Set up a newsletter from scratch
- Built a full content distribution strategy
- Reviewed my homepage design

The insight that transfers to work: most AI tools have memory now, but there's a difference between "remembers a few facts" and "actively connects context across file access, scheduled jobs, and every task it runs."

After 48 hours, OpenClaw wasn't just recalling my goals — it was connecting morning research to afternoon strategy without being asked. That depth of integration changes how you work with AI.

The mental model shift: from "AI as tool I query" to "AI as partner I work with."

I wrote up the full breakdown — setup, costs, honest failures, and what I learned — on my blog.
