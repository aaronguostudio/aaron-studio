## Tweet 1 (Hook)
I had a Mac mini collecting dust.

I set up an AI agent on it Saturday morning.

By Sunday night, it had:
- Analyzed my blog
- Studied 5 top creators
- Set up my newsletter
- Built my entire X strategy

Total cost: $0 (already owned the hardware).

Here's what happened:

## Tweet 2 (The Setup)
The setup took ~2 hours:

- Installed OpenClaw (open source, free)
- Connected it to WhatsApp
- Set up Tailscale for remote access
- Named the agent GG

Now I have a 24/7 AI partner on my home network that can browse the web, run commands, read my files, and remember everything.

## Tweet 3 (Day 1 — The Honest Part)
Day 1 reality check:

I scheduled a morning briefing. It failed. The email CLI wasn't authenticated yet.

This is what "building with AI" actually looks like. It breaks. You fix it in 5 minutes. You keep going.

The difference between AI hype and AI workflow is right here — you iterate, not panic.

## Tweet 4 (Day 2 — The Payoff)
Day 2 is where it got wild.

In a single day, GG:
- Deep-analyzed my entire blog with specific fixes
- Researched 5 creator strategies (Justin Welsh, Pieter Levels, Sahil Bloom...)
- Set up my Beehiiv newsletter from scratch
- Built a full X content strategy with posting cadence
- Reviewed my homepage design

All while I focused on other things.

## Tweet 5 (The Insight)
The real unlock isn't any single task.

It's the compounding.

Sure, ChatGPT has memory. But OpenClaw goes deeper — structured memory files tied into file access, shell commands, scheduled jobs, and web browsing.

By end of Day 2, GG connects the morning's research to the afternoon's strategy without being asked.
