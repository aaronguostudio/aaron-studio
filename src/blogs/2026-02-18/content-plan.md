# Content Plan: I Had a Mac Mini Collecting Dust. It Now Runs My Entire Content Operation.

## Voice Check

**Positioning:** Ship with AI, not about AI — builder who ships, not commentator.
**Voice rule:** Use "I" not "you should." Share what I did, not what others should do.
**This post's personal anchor:** I set up OpenClaw on a Mac mini I already had, named the agent GG, and within 48 hours it analyzed my blog, benchmarked competitors, set up my newsletter, built my X strategy, and is now collaborating on content plans. This actually happened Feb 15-16, 2026.

## Hook / Opening

**Blog hook:** I had a Mac mini sitting on a shelf doing nothing. Last Saturday, I installed OpenClaw on it, connected it to WhatsApp, and gave the agent a name — GG. Within 48 hours, GG had done more for my content business than I'd accomplished in the previous month. This is what an AI-native workflow actually looks like — no hype, just a $599 machine and a builder willing to try something different.

**X thread hook (tweet 1):** "I had a Mac mini collecting dust. I set up an AI agent on it Saturday morning. By Sunday night, it had analyzed my blog, benchmarked 5 competitors, set up my newsletter, and built my entire X strategy. Total cost: $0 (already owned the hardware). Here's what happened:"

## Core Argument / Thesis

The real power of AI isn't in any single chat session — it's in having a persistent agent with context about your work, your goals, and your projects that compounds knowledge over time. A repurposed Mac mini running OpenClaw can replace the output of a small content team, not because the AI is smarter than people, but because it never sleeps, never loses context, and builds on every interaction.

## Outline

### Section 1: The Setup (Saturday Morning)
- The Mac mini was already there — repurposed from collecting dust
- OpenClaw installation: gateway as a service, WhatsApp channel, Tailscale for remote access
- Naming the agent GG — making it feel like a collaborator, not a tool
- The infrastructure: SSH, screen sharing, configured to never sleep
- Keep it practical — show the real commands and config, not a polished tutorial

### Section 2: Day 1 — First Boot to First Value (Feb 15)
- Establishing identity and working relationship with GG
- Setting up scheduled jobs: morning briefing, content research, nightly report
- The morning briefing failure — gog CLI wasn't authenticated yet, so the scheduled job broke. Include this honestly. The fix was straightforward but the failure is relatable.
- First real task: exploring my content studio workflow (the skills pipeline)
- The "aha moment" — realizing GG could browse the web, run commands, and maintain context across sessions

### Section 3: Day 2 — The Compounding Effect (Feb 16)
- This is the money section. Show the sheer volume of output:
  - Deep analysis of aaronguo.com with specific improvement recommendations
  - Competitor research: Justin Welsh, Pieter Levels, Lenny Rachitsky, Sahil Bloom — with actionable takeaways
  - Set up "Ship with AI" newsletter on Beehiiv
  - Researched Beehiiv + Nuxt 3 integration
  - Deep research on X/Twitter strategy (algorithm, creator revenue, content formats)
  - Built a full X content strategy roadmap
  - Homepage design review
- The key insight: every task built on the last. By the end of Day 2, GG knows my positioning, goals, voice, and projects. It's not starting from zero each time.
- Contrast with ChatGPT: "In a browser tab, I'd have to re-explain my entire context every session. GG has memory files — daily notes and long-term memory — so continuity is built in."

### Section 4: What This Actually Costs (The ROI)
- Hardware: $599 Mac mini (or $0 if you already have one)
- Software: OpenClaw is open source (free)
- API costs: estimate the Claude API spend for 48 hours of heavy usage
- Compare to: hiring a content strategist ($5K-10K/month), a freelance researcher ($50-100/hr), or a virtual assistant ($15-30/hr)
- The honest caveat: GG isn't replacing human creativity or judgment. It's replacing the research, analysis, and execution grunt work so I can focus on the creative decisions.

### Conclusion / Call to Action
- The shift isn't about the tool — it's about moving from "AI as search engine" to "AI as persistent partner"
- The compounding effect is the real unlock: after 48 hours, the agent has enough context to be genuinely useful without hand-holding
- If you have a Mac mini (or any always-on machine), the barrier to trying this is one afternoon
- Blog CTA: newsletter signup — "I'm documenting this entire journey in my newsletter, Ship with AI"
- Thread CTA: "Follow me — I'm sharing what I learn building with AI every week" (cta_rotation: follow)

## SEO Notes

**Primary keyword:** Mac mini AI agent
**Secondary keywords:** OpenClaw setup, AI content team, personal AI assistant 2026, always-on AI agent
**Search intent:** Informational — people searching "Mac mini AI agent" want to see real experiences, not just setup guides. This post answers "what happens after you set it up?"

## Distribution Plan

### X Thread Brief (publish: Wednesday, Feb 18)
**Format:** 5-8 tweets, standalone value. NO link in main thread.
**Hook (tweet 1):** "I had a Mac mini collecting dust. I set up an AI agent on it Saturday morning. By Sunday night, it had analyzed my blog, benchmarked 5 competitors, set up my newsletter, and built my entire X strategy. Total cost: $0 (already owned the hardware). Here's what happened:"
**Key tweets (2-5):**
- Tweet 2: The setup — OpenClaw + WhatsApp + Tailscale. Named the agent GG. Took ~2 hours to get running. (include Mac mini photo)
- Tweet 3: Day 1 reality check — scheduled the morning briefing. It failed. gog CLI wasn't authenticated. This is what "building with AI" actually looks like. You fix it and keep going.
- Tweet 4: Day 2 is where it got wild. GG analyzed my entire blog, researched 5 competitor creators, set up my Beehiiv newsletter, and built a full X content strategy. All while I focused on other things.
- Tweet 5: The real unlock isn't any single task. It's the compounding. By end of Day 2, GG knows my positioning, goals, voice, and projects. It doesn't start from zero each session. (include WhatsApp screenshot showing context-aware conversation)
**Closing tweet:** "I'm documenting my entire journey building with AI. Follow along — I ship weekly." (CTA: follow)
**Reply with link:** "Full deep dive with the complete setup, costs, and what I'd do differently: [blog URL]" — posted as a reply, NOT in the thread.
**Visual:** WhatsApp screenshot of GG conversation (tweet 5), Mac mini photo (tweet 2), architecture diagram showing Mac mini -> OpenClaw -> WhatsApp -> skills pipeline (tweet 1 or reply)

### X Standalone Tweet Brief (publish: Friday, Feb 20)
**Format:** Single tweet with image.
**The insight:** "The biggest surprise from running an AI agent 24/7: it's not the individual tasks that impress you. It's the compounding. After 48 hours, my agent has enough context about my work that it stops asking obvious questions. That's when it starts feeling less like a tool and more like a teammate."
**Image idea:** Architecture diagram showing the context flow: conversations -> memory files -> scheduled jobs -> outputs

### X Article Brief (publish: Saturday, Feb 21, optional)
**Angle:** "The Always-On AI: Why Persistence Changes Everything" — a deeper exploration of why persistent context (memory files, scheduled jobs, cross-session continuity) is the actual breakthrough, not the model itself. Compare ephemeral AI (ChatGPT sessions) vs persistent AI (OpenClaw-style agents). This is the conceptual companion piece to the tactical blog post.
**Working title:** "The Always-On AI: Why Persistence Changes Everything"
**Why it's different from the blog:** The blog is "here's what happened in 48 hours" (narrative). The X Article is "here's why this pattern matters for everyone" (framework). Different reader, different value.

### Newsletter Brief (publish: Wednesday, Feb 18)
**Teaser:** "Last Saturday I set up an AI agent on a Mac mini I had collecting dust. 48 hours later, it had done more for my content business than I'd done in a month — analyzed my blog, benchmarked competitors, set up my newsletter (yes, this one), and built my entire X strategy. I wrote up the full story with the real setup, costs, and honest failures. Read the full post ->"
**Link destination:** blog post URL (NOT the X thread)

### LinkedIn Brief (publish: Thursday, Feb 19)
**Angle:** Frame as a leadership/productivity insight for product leaders: "As a product leader, I'm always looking for leverage. Last weekend I set up an AI agent as a persistent partner for my side projects. The insight that transfers to work: the value of AI isn't in individual prompts — it's in persistent context that compounds." More professional framing, less "solopreneur" and more "product leader exploring AI-native workflows."
**Format:** Text post, link to blog in comments

**Translate:** Full blog post + X thread

## Personal Experience Notes

- The Mac mini was a repurposed device, NOT bought for this — makes the story more relatable ("you probably already have the hardware")
- GG is the agent's name — use it consistently to humanize the experience
- The morning briefing failure (gog CLI auth) is the key "warts and all" moment. Include the error, the fix, and the lesson: AI workflows break just like any other software. The difference is you iterate fast.
- The Day 2 compounding moment is the emotional peak — when GG started referencing earlier conversations and context without being asked. That's when it stopped feeling like a chatbot.
- Specific competitors GG researched: Justin Welsh, Pieter Levels, Lenny Rachitsky, Sahil Bloom — include what was learned from each
- The Beehiiv newsletter "Ship with AI" was literally set up by GG during this 48-hour period
- The X strategy (src/strategy/x.md) that we're now executing was co-created with GG — this is a meta moment worth highlighting
- Tone throughout: builder sharing what works. Practical, specific, honest. Not "AI will change everything" — more "here's exactly what happened when I tried it."
