## Illustration 1

**Position**: After Section 1 (The Setup — Saturday Morning), after the paragraph about having a 24/7 AI agent accessible through WhatsApp
**Purpose**: Visualize the complete home setup — Mac mini as the quiet always-on hub connected to the user's world
**Visual Content**: A clean home desk scene showing a Mac mini with subtle indicator lights, connected via visual lines to a phone (WhatsApp), a laptop (Tailscale), and cloud icons (web/APIs). The Mac mini is the calm center of a connected ecosystem. Warm lighting, evening/weekend feel. A small label or speech bubble with "GG" near the Mac mini to personify the agent.
**Type Application**: Scene — establishing the physical setup and the "cozy home lab" atmosphere

## Illustration 2

**Position**: After Section 2 (Day 1 — First Boot to First Value), after the paragraph about the morning briefing failure and the lesson about iterating
**Purpose**: Visualize the builder's iteration loop — things break, you fix them, you keep going. Normalizes failure as part of the AI workflow.
**Visual Content**: A looping cycle diagram rendered as a scene: a developer at a desk sees a red error notification, then calmly fixes it (wrench/tool icon), then a green checkmark appears, then the cycle continues forward. The mood is calm and confident, not stressful. Flat vector style with a circular flow showing: break → diagnose → fix → ship → repeat.
**Type Application**: Scene — the emotional experience of iterating, not just the process

## Illustration 3

**Position**: After Section 3 (Day 2 — The Compounding Effect), after the paragraph about the compounding effect and structured memory
**Purpose**: Visualize the compounding context — each task building on the previous one, with memory as the connective tissue
**Visual Content**: A layered scene showing stacked blocks or layers growing upward like a tower. Bottom layer: "Blog Analysis," next: "Competitor Research," then "Newsletter Setup," then "Content Strategy," then "Homepage Review." Connecting lines or threads run between layers showing how each builds on the last. At the center or side, a memory/brain icon collects and connects everything. The tower grows from left to right, getting richer and more interconnected. Clean vector style with warm color accents.
**Type Application**: Scene — the growing, compounding feeling of context accumulation

## Illustration 4

**Position**: After Section 4 (What I Actually Learned), after the paragraph about the mental model shift from tool to partner
**Purpose**: Visualize the core thesis — the shift from treating AI as a tool you query to a partner you work with
**Visual Content**: A split scene. Left side: a person typing into a blank chat window, alone, sterile, single-directional arrow. Label: "Tool." Right side: two figures (a person and a friendly AI avatar/robot) sitting side by side at a desk, co-working, arrows flowing both directions, shared documents and context visible between them. Label: "Partner." The right side is warmer, more connected, more alive. Clean vector illustration with clear contrast between the two sides.
**Type Application**: Scene — the emotional contrast between two modes of working with AI
