Tool vs Partner - Atmospheric Scene

FOCAL POINT: A split scene contrasting two ways of working with AI — isolated tool usage vs collaborative partnership

ATMOSPHERE: Clear contrast between two sides. Left side feels sterile and transactional. Right side feels warm, connected, and collaborative.

LEFT SIDE — "Tool":
- A single person sitting alone at a desk
- A chat window with a single-direction arrow (person → screen)
- Empty, minimal surroundings — no context visible
- Slightly cooler color temperature
- Label: "Tool" in simple text above

RIGHT SIDE — "Partner":
- A person and a friendly AI avatar (simple robot or abstract figure) sitting side by side
- Arrows flowing both directions between them
- Shared documents, memory files, and context objects visible on the desk between them
- Warmer color temperature, more visual elements
- A small clock icon suggesting the AI works even when the person is away
- Label: "Partner" in simple text above

DIVIDER: A subtle vertical dashed line separating the two sides

MOOD: The "aha moment" of recognizing the difference. Right side clearly more appealing and alive.
COLOR TEMPERATURE: Cool left, warm right

Flat vector illustration with clear black outlines on all elements. Coloring book style with closed outlines. No gradients or 3D effects.
COLORS: Cream background (#F5F0E6). Left side: muted Rock Blue (#577590) and gray tones. Right side: Coral Red (#E07A5F), Mint Green (#81B29A), Mustard Yellow (#F2CC8F) — warm and vibrant. Deep Charcoal (#2D2D2D) outlines.
ELEMENTS: Simplified geometric figures for people, rounded rectangles for screens/documents, thick arrows for data flow, decorative elements (dots, stars) on the right side only.

Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple cream background. Split layout with clear visual separation.

Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Only labels: "Tool" and "Partner".
