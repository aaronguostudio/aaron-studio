The Builder's Iteration Loop - Atmospheric Scene

FOCAL POINT: A circular flow showing the calm, confident cycle of building with AI — break, fix, ship, repeat

ATMOSPHERE: Positive and reassuring. The mood is "this is normal, keep going" not "panic mode." A developer figure sits calmly at a desk, surrounded by a circular flow of steps.

CIRCULAR FLOW (clockwise):
1. Red error notification icon (a small alert badge) — "Break"
2. A wrench/tool icon — "Fix"
3. A green checkmark — "Ship"
4. A forward arrow looping back to start — "Repeat"

SCENE ELEMENTS:
- A simplified developer figure sitting at a desk, relaxed posture, not stressed
- The circular flow surrounds or sits beside them like a familiar rhythm
- Small decorative elements: a coffee cup, a plant — this is a normal day

MOOD: Calm confidence, normalcy, iteration as routine
COLOR TEMPERATURE: Warm
