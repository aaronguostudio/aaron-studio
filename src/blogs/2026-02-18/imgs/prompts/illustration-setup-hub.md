The Always-On AI Hub - Atmospheric Scene

FOCAL POINT: A Mac mini sitting on a clean desk, glowing subtly with a small indicator light, as the calm center of a connected ecosystem

ATMOSPHERE: Cozy home office, evening weekend feel, warm inviting lighting. A desk with a Mac mini as the hero object. Visual connection lines radiate outward from the Mac mini to surrounding devices and services.

CONNECTED ELEMENTS:
- A smartphone showing a WhatsApp chat interface (labeled "GG") floating to the right
- A laptop (MacBook) connected via a dashed line labeled "Tailscale"
- Small cloud icons representing web browsing and API access floating above
- A small clock/calendar icon representing scheduled jobs

MOOD: Calm, empowering, a builder's personal setup that feels both technical and homey
COLOR TEMPERATURE: Warm

Flat vector illustration with clear black outlines on all elements. Coloring book style with closed outlines. No gradients or 3D effects.
COLORS: Cream background (#F5F0E6), Coral Red (#E07A5F) for the Mac mini glow and WhatsApp accent, Mint Green (#81B29A) for connection lines, Mustard Yellow (#F2CC8F) for cloud/API icons, Rock Blue (#577590) for the laptop. Deep Charcoal (#2D2D2D) outlines.
ELEMENTS: Geometric simplified devices, rounded line endings, decorative dots and stars around the Mac mini to suggest "always-on" activity. People as simple geometric figures if shown.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple cream background. Main elements centered with the Mac mini as the visual anchor.

Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal — only "GG" on the phone screen and small labels on connection lines.
