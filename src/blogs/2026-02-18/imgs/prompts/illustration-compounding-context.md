The Compounding Effect - Atmospheric Scene

FOCAL POINT: Stacked layers growing upward like building blocks, each connected by threads of context, showing how tasks compound on each other

ATMOSPHERE: A sense of growth and momentum. Each layer builds on the last, getting richer and more interconnected. An upward energy.

STACKED LAYERS (bottom to top):
1. Bottom layer: "Blog Analysis" — a document icon with a magnifying glass
2. Next layer: "Competitor Research" — multiple profile/avatar icons
3. Next layer: "Newsletter Setup" — an envelope icon with "Ship with AI"
4. Next layer: "Content Strategy" — a calendar/grid icon
5. Top layer: "Homepage Review" — a browser window icon

CONNECTING ELEMENTS:
- Thin connecting lines or threads running between layers showing dependencies
- A brain/memory icon on the side collecting threads from all layers
- Small arrows showing information flowing upward from layer to layer
- The layers get slightly wider or more detailed as they go up, suggesting compounding

MOOD: Momentum, accumulation, the satisfying feeling of things building on each other
COLOR TEMPERATURE: Warm

Flat vector illustration with clear black outlines on all elements. Coloring book style with closed outlines. No gradients or 3D effects.
COLORS: Cream background (#F5F0E6), each layer in alternating Coral Red (#E07A5F), Mint Green (#81B29A), Mustard Yellow (#F2CC8F), Rock Blue (#577590), Burnt Orange (#D4764A). Connecting threads in Mint Green. Deep Charcoal (#2D2D2D) outlines.
ELEMENTS: Rounded rectangle blocks for each layer, simple geometric icons inside each, thick connecting lines between layers, decorative dots and stars.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple cream background. Layers centered and growing upward.

Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Each layer labeled with its task name.
