Did you catch that? Anthropic didn’t just drop some plugins this week — they rolled out a whole blueprint for what an AI-native financial firm should look like. It’s modular, data-connected, and super specific to workflows... Plus, anyone who knows their stuff can customize it. How cool is that?

Are you a product leader in finance? Well, let’s break this down into three essential moves. First up... audit your data contracts right now. Seriously, take a look at which of those eleven providers you're already paying for. Those are like free wins just waiting for you! 

Next, dive into those skill files. Even if you’re not rolling anything out tomorrow, they give you a solid framework of how financial workflows should be set up. Think of it as your roadmap to success. 

Lastly, don’t wait too long to kick off the compliance conversation. The technical side of things is usually a breeze, but the real heavy lifting? That’s where the timeline gets stretched. Trust me, starting early makes all the difference.

This is an entire organizational knowledge system that actually gets better and more valuable as time goes on. Now, if you're one of those companies sitting back, waiting for a vendor to swoop in and package this up for you, brace yourself... because you'll end up paying three times more for something that’s already outdated. Yikes, right?
