Most coverage really misses the mark on this. The commands and outputs? Nah, that’s not the juicy part of this launch. Not even in the same ballpark.

Did you catch this? FactSet, S&P Global, Morningstar, Moody's, LSEG, PitchBook... that’s a lineup of eleven top-tier institutional data vendors. You know, the ones that love charging a pretty penny for their services—thousands of dollars per seat and those long, multi-year enterprise contracts. Well, they all decided to build native connectors for Claude. And guess what? They did it all in the same launch window. Coincidence? I think not!

When you see all these established players, you know, the big names, suddenly moving in sync... it’s not just some new product hitting the market. Nope. That’s a whole new standard being set right before our eyes.

Remember back in the twenty-tens when Bloomberg and FactSet decided to open their APIs? It was a game changer, right? A whole wave of fintech sprang up from that move. Well, here we are in twenty twenty-six, and it feels like we're at a similar crossroads. The groundwork is being laid, and those data pipes are ready to flow.

The market definitely gave us a thumbs up on that one... Thomson Reuters shot up by eleven percent, and FactSet followed closely with a six percent bump right after the announcement. Why? Well, Wall Street figured out that Anthropic isn’t trying to take on these data companies; they’re teaming up with them instead. Think of it this way: the data vendors are the pipes, and Claude? He’s just the plumber making sure everything flows smoothly.
