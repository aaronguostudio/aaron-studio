Reading about it is one thing, right? But I was curious about what it really churns out when put to the test. So... I decided to dive in and run two tests — a DCF model and a client report.

Guess what? The DCF turned out to be a legit Excel workbook. Not just some boring screenshot or a flat table. We're talking about a live model that had formula references, linked cells, and even a sensitivity table. It laid out the revenue build, margin assumptions, terminal value, WACC calculation, and an implied valuation range. Super investment banking vibes, right? Sure, it wasn’t flawless — there were definitely some assumptions I’d tweak — but the overall structure was spot on.

You wouldn’t believe how the client report turned out. It had a solid structure — you know, like your classic executive summary, followed by key metrics and portfolio commentary. Everything was in professional language, all polished and ready for the client’s eyes. I wouldn't just send it off without a bit of review, but it was a really strong first draft. Honestly, it tackled that dreaded blank page issue like a champ!

Let me share something that’s pretty important. It’s not about having the perfect output... it’s all about having the right starting point. Think about it: a blank Excel sheet and a blank document? Totally different ballgame from a well-structured workbook and a polished draft. One’s just a task waiting to be tackled, while the other is more of an editing gig. That transition—from staring at a blank page to having a solid foundation—is really where all the time gets eaten up. Crazy, right?
