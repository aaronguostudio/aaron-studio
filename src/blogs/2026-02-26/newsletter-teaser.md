Anthropic released financial-services-plugins this week — five Claude plugins wired to 11 institutional data sources including FactSet, S&P Global, Moody's, and PitchBook. Zero code. Pure Markdown + JSON. Open source.

I'm a tech product head at a financial firm who builds AI tools on the side. I read the entire repo, then ran it on real work — produced a DCF model and a client report. Wrote up what I actually found.

Three things I didn't expect: the skill files are genuinely well-designed domain knowledge (not generic prompts), the real story is the MCP connectors and what it means that every major financial data vendor built one simultaneously, and the skills-as-Markdown architecture feels like a pattern that's going to generalize far beyond finance. The software increasingly is the Markdown.

Also share the actual DCF and client report outputs so you can see what the tool produces.
