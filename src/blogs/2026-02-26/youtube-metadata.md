## Title
Anthropic Just Gave Wall Street an AI Blueprint. I Ran It on Real Work.

## Description
Anthropic released open-source financial services plugins for Claude this week — five modules covering DCF models, equity research, investment banking, private equity, and wealth management, wired to 11 institutional data sources including FactSet, S&P Global, Moody's, and PitchBook. I build software at a financial firm. I read the entire repo, then ran it on real work. Here's what I actually found.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Anthropic released 5 open-source finance plugins for Claude: investment banking, equity research, private equity, wealth management + core financial analysis
- The real signal isn't the plugins — it's that 11 major data vendors (FactSet, S&P Global, Moody's, LSEG, PitchBook) all built MCP connectors simultaneously, declaring a new industry standard
- Thomson Reuters +11%, FactSet +6% after the announcement — the market priced in partnership, not disruption
- I ran the DCF and client report commands on real work — the output isn't perfect, but the starting point is right, and that's where most of the time goes
- The skill-file pattern (domain knowledge in structured files, not code) is a paradigm shift that will generalize beyond finance
- What I estimated as weeks of engineering became hours of writing a single skill file
- The real adoption blocker isn't AI — it's data contracts. If your firm doesn't subscribe to the data vendors, you're not unlocking full power
