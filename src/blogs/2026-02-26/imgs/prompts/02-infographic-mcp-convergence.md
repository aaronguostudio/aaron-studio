MCP Protocol Convergence — Wall Street's New Standard

Layout: horizontal flow diagram, left-to-right with three zones

LEFT ZONE — "The Data Vendors":
- 11 nodes arranged in two vertical columns:
  Row 1: FactSet, S&P Global, Morningstar, Moody's, LSEG, PitchBook
  Row 2: Chronograph, Daloopa, Aiera, MT Newswires, Egnyte
- Each node is a small labeled rectangle
- Label above: "Institutional Data Infrastructure"
- Sub-label: "$2,400–$10,000+/seat · Multi-year contracts"
- All 11 nodes have connector lines pointing RIGHT toward center

CENTER ZONE — "MCP Protocol":
- Single prominent hexagonal or circular hub, larger than surrounding elements
- Bold label: "MCP Protocol"
- Sub-label: "The Standard"
- Radiating connection points on both left and right sides
- Thin dimension lines indicating it's the convergence point

RIGHT ZONE — "Claude + Outputs":
- Claude node receiving from MCP hub
- Three output boxes below Claude: "Excel (live formulas)", "PowerPoint", "Word"
- Downward arrows from Claude to outputs

MARKET REACTION CALLOUT (bottom right corner):
- Small annotation box: "Market reaction to partnership announcement:"
- Thomson Reuters: +11% ↑
- FactSet: +6% ↑
- Style: engineering annotation with leader line

KEY INSIGHT LABEL (top of diagram):
- "When ALL of them build MCP connectors simultaneously — that's a standard, not a product launch."
