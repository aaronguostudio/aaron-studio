Paradigm Shift — Agentic Workflow vs Skill File

Layout: two-column split comparison, vertical center divider

LEFT COLUMN — "Build Agentic Workflow" (Before):
- Header box: "Build Agentic Workflow" in bold
- Sub-header: "Weeks of engineering"
- Stack of 6 process boxes connected by downward arrows:
  1. "Data Pipeline Design"
  2. "Orchestration Logic"
  3. "Output Template"
  4. "Systems Integration"
  5. "Testing"
  6. "Ongoing Maintenance"
- Bottom label: "Dedicated engineer required"
- Subtle amber warning tint on boxes to signal complexity/cost

CENTER DIVIDER:
- Bold vertical line
- Arrow pointing RIGHT labeled "The Paradigm Shift"

RIGHT COLUMN — "Write a Skill File" (After):
- Header box: "Write a Skill File" in bold
- Sub-header: "Hours"
- Three simple steps:
  1. "One Markdown File" — with annotation: "encodes domain logic, readable by any senior person"
  2. "Run Command" — e.g., /investment-recommendation [client]
  3. "Structured Output" — "formatted to firm standard, ready for review"
- Bottom label: "No code. Version-controlled. Team-editable."
- Engineering blue tint on boxes to signal clean/efficient

KEY INSIGHT (bottom center spanning both columns):
- "Any workflow that can be encoded as structured reasoning belongs in a skill file now, not a pipeline."

COLORS:
- Background: Blueprint Off-White #FAF8F5 with subtle grid
- Left column header: Amber #F59E0B, process boxes Light Blue tint
- Right column header: Engineering Blue #2563EB, step boxes Light Blue #BFDBFE
- Center divider: Deep Slate #334155, 2px line
- Arrows: Deep Slate #334155
- Key insight text: Deep Slate #334155, italicized

STYLE: Blueprint technical schematic, precise alignment, grid-based layout, engineering precision, no decorative elements

Clean split layout with clear visual separation. Generous white space around elements. ASPECT: 16:9
