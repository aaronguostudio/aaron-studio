Wall Street's AI Stack — The Blueprint Just Went Open Source

CONCEPT: A dramatic blueprint technical schematic of a complete financial AI infrastructure, rendered as an architectural engineering drawing. The moment the blueprint "goes public."

LAYOUT: Full-width centered composition. The entire image is a blueprint-style engineering diagram of a financial AI stack. Think: classified technical document just declassified.

MAIN DIAGRAM (center):
- Large architectural blueprint of a three-layer system tower
- TOP LAYER: Labeled box "Claude + Skills" with sub-labels: "41 Skills · 38 Commands"
- MIDDLE LAYER: Four horizontal boxes side by side: "Investment Banking · Equity Research · Private Equity · Wealth Management"
- BOTTOM LAYER: Row of 11 small connector nodes: FactSet · S&P Global · Morningstar · Moody's · LSEG · PitchBook · Chronograph · Daloopa · Aiera · MT Newswires · Egnyte
- Upward arrows from bottom nodes through middle tier into top Claude box
- All connected with precise 90-degree engineering connector lines

TITLE BLOCK (top left, like an engineering drawing title block):
- "ANTHROPIC FINANCIAL SERVICES"
- "AI STACK — COMPLETE ARCHITECTURE"
- Smaller: "Apache 2.0 · Open Source · Released Feb 2026"

CORNER ELEMENTS:
- Top right: Small "OPEN SOURCE" stamp/badge, angular design
- Bottom right: Engineering drawing reference box with "Rev 1.0 · Public Release"
- Subtle grid overlay on entire background

ATMOSPHERE: The feel of a highly classified technical document that has just been made public. Engineering precision meets institutional gravity.

COLORS:
- Background: Blueprint Off-White #FAF8F5 with fine grid lines
- Main diagram elements: Engineering Blue #2563EB fill on key boxes, white text
- Specialist layer: Navy Blue #1E3A5F fill
- Data connectors: Light Blue #BFDBFE fill, Deep Slate #334155 text
- Connector lines: Deep Slate #334155, 1.5px precise lines
- Open Source stamp: Amber #F59E0B, angular badge style
- Grid lines: Very subtle #E2E8F0

STYLE: Blueprint technical schematic, architectural drawing precision, grid-aligned, monospace annotations, engineering title block, no decorative elements. Feels like a real technical blueprint of a financial system.

Clean composition. Blueprint-paper background. Title block in top-left corner. Main diagram centered. ASPECT: 16:9
