## [SCENE 01: Hook — 7s]

**Video prompt:** A sleek modern office at night, a single person sitting at a desk with multiple monitors showing financial charts and spreadsheets, dramatic blue-tinted lighting reflecting off glass walls, camera slowly pushing in toward the screens, cinematic shallow depth of field, moody atmosphere.

**Motion:** Slow push-in

**Narration:**
Everyone's asking if Anthropic's new finance plugins will replace junior analysts. I manage analysts. I build software at a financial firm. I spent the week going through the code, and then I ran it on real work. Here's my actual take.

---

## [SCENE 02: What Anthropic Released — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A futuristic holographic interface materializing in mid-air, showing five glowing interconnected module blocks labeled with financial icons, each block lighting up one by one, dark background with subtle particle effects, clean modern tech aesthetic, camera orbiting around the display.

**Motion:** Slow orbit

**Text overlay:** "Anthropic Financial Services Plugins — Open Source, February 2026"

**Narration:**
This week, Anthropic released an open-source collection of financial plugins for Claude. Five modules covering almost everything a finance team produces: from DCF models to equity research reports to investment committee memos.

---

## [SCENE 03: The Five Modules — 8s]

**Video prompt:** Five floating translucent cards arranged in a semicircle, each glowing a different color, representing investment banking, equity research, private equity, wealth management, and a central core module, dark gradient background, soft volumetric lighting, clean minimal design.

**Motion:** Slow zoom out revealing all five cards

**Text overlay:** "Investment Banking · Equity Research · Private Equity · Wealth Management · Core Financial Analysis"

**Narration:**
A core foundation layer, plus four specialist modules. Investment banking for deal materials and merger models. Equity research for earnings reports and investment theses. Private equity for due diligence and portfolio monitoring. Wealth management for client meetings and financial plans.

---

## [SCENE 04: What It Actually Does — 7s]

**Video prompt:** A close-up of a laptop screen showing a command prompt, with a financial spreadsheet materializing line by line in real-time on the right side, numbers and charts flowing into place, warm office lighting reflected on the screen, photorealistic, shallow depth of field.

**Motion:** Slow push-in toward the screen

**Narration:**
You type a command, name a company, and Claude produces a full Excel workbook with live formulas, or a PowerPoint in your firm's branded template. No code required. Forty-one built-in skills. Thirty-eight commands. All open source.

---

## [SCENE 05: Transition — The Real Signal — 6s]

**Video prompt:** Camera pulling back from the laptop screen to reveal a massive wall of illuminated corporate logos — financial data vendor logos arranged in a grid, all connected by glowing data streams flowing toward a central point, dramatic scale shift from small to large, dark cinematic environment.

**Motion:** Dramatic pull-back and tilt up

**Narration:**
But here's the thing. The commands and the outputs are not the most interesting part of this launch. Not even close.

---

## [SCENE 06: The Data Vendors — 8s]

**Video prompt:** Eleven glowing pillars standing in a semicircle, each representing a major financial institution, all connected by streams of flowing data converging into a single glowing protocol symbol in the center, epic scale, blue and white color palette, futuristic architectural space, cinematic wide shot.

**Motion:** Slow orbit around the pillars

**Text overlay:** "FactSet · S&P Global · Morningstar · Moody's · LSEG · PitchBook — 11 data vendors, one protocol"

**Narration:**
FactSet. S&P Global. Morningstar. Moody's. LSEG. PitchBook. Eleven institutional data vendors — the ones that charge thousands per seat with multi-year contracts — all built native connectors for Claude. In the same launch window. All at once.

---

## [SCENE 07: What This Means — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A time-lapse of a massive infrastructure being built — steel beams, data cables, network connections being laid down at accelerated speed, transforming from raw construction into a polished modern data highway, golden sunrise lighting in the background, epic construction montage feel.

**Motion:** Time-lapse tracking shot

**Narration:**
When incumbents this entrenched all move in the same direction at once, that's not a product launch. That's a standard being declared. Think about what happened when Bloomberg and FactSet opened their APIs in the twenty-tens. A whole generation of fintech got built on top. This is the twenty-twenty-six version of that moment. The data pipes are being laid.

---

## [SCENE 08: Market Reaction — 6s]

**Video prompt:** A stock market trading floor with green numbers rising on large digital screens, traders watching screens showing upward-trending charts, energetic green and blue lighting, bustling atmosphere, camera sweeping across the floor, cinematic motion blur.

**Motion:** Sweeping pan across the trading floor

**Text overlay:** "Thomson Reuters +11%  ·  FactSet +6%  — Post-announcement"

**Narration:**
The market confirmed the read. Thomson Reuters jumped eleven percent. FactSet rose six percent after the announcement. They rallied because Wall Street realized Anthropic is partnering with these data vendors, not competing with them. Data vendors are the pipes. Claude is the plumber.

---

## [SCENE 09: Transition to Personal Test — 6s]

**Video prompt:** A person walking into a home office, setting down a coffee cup, sitting at a desk with a single clean monitor, rolling up sleeves, morning sunlight streaming through window blinds, warm intimate atmosphere, camera tracking the person from behind as they sit down.

**Motion:** Tracking shot following the person

**Narration:**
Reading about it is one thing. I wanted to know what it actually produces. So I ran it on real work. A DCF model and a client report. Here's what came back.

---

## [SCENE 10: The DCF Test — 8s]

**Video prompt:** An Excel spreadsheet being constructed in real-time on a large monitor, cells filling with numbers, formulas appearing, charts drawing themselves, rows and columns of financial data building up like a time-lapse of construction, blue-lit office environment, close-up on the screen.

**Motion:** Slow push-in with slight tilt

**Text overlay:** "Live DCF Model — Revenue build, WACC, sensitivity tables, working formulas"

**Narration:**
The DCF came back as a proper Excel workbook. Not a screenshot or a static table. A live model with formula references, linked cells, and a sensitivity table. Revenue build, margin assumptions, terminal value, WACC calculation, implied valuation range. Investment banking structure. Was it perfect? No. But the scaffolding was right.

---

## [SCENE 11: The Client Report — 7s]

**Video prompt:** A polished document appearing on screen, pages flipping through showing professional formatting — executive summary, charts, portfolio commentary sections, clean typography, warm lighting on the document, as if printed and laid on a wooden desk, overhead camera angle.

**Motion:** Slow zoom out

**Narration:**
The client report was similarly structured. Executive summary, key metrics, portfolio commentary. Professional language, formatted for a client-facing context. Not something I'd send without review — but a very solid first draft.

---

## [SCENE 12: The Real Value — 8s]

**Video prompt:** Split screen — left side shows a blank white Excel sheet and empty Word document, cold blue lighting, feeling of emptiness and dread. Right side shows a fully structured workbook and formatted report, warm golden lighting, feeling of progress and momentum. A dividing line between the two halves.

**Motion:** Static with subtle parallax between halves

**Text overlay:** "A blank page is a task. A structured draft is an editing job."

**Narration:**
Here's the insight. The value isn't that the output is perfect. It's that the starting point is right. A blank Excel and a blank document are very different from a correctly structured workbook and a formatted draft. The first is a task. The second is an editing job. That gap — from blank page to structured starting point — is where most of the time actually goes.

---

## [SCENE 13: The Paradigm Shift — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A dramatic transformation sequence — traditional lines of code dissolving and reforming into clean readable text documents, like code melting away to reveal simple English underneath, abstract visualization, dark background with flowing particles of light, magical transformation aesthetic.

**Motion:** Slow push-in through the transformation

**Narration:**
But after using this, I came away thinking about something even bigger than these specific plugins. The architecture here — domain knowledge encoded in simple structured files, organized into skills and commands, wired to data sources — is a pattern that's going to generalize far beyond finance. The software is not the code anymore. The software is the knowledge.

---

## [SCENE 14: My Personal Test — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A person in a modern office standing at a whiteboard covered with workflow diagrams and arrows, then turning to look at a single clean document on a screen, the whiteboard diagrams fading into the background as the simple document glows brighter, metaphor for complexity becoming simplicity, warm lighting.

**Motion:** Focus shift from whiteboard to screen

**Narration:**
This became real for me through a project at my firm. We were trying to automate personalized investment recommendations. The original plan was to build a full system from scratch — design the data pipeline, write the logic, build the output template, wire it to our systems. Weeks of engineering. A dedicated person to maintain it.

---

## [SCENE 15: The Breakthrough — 7s]

**Video prompt:** A single document glowing on a clean minimal desk, radiating light outward like a beacon, surrounding complexity and machinery fading away into darkness, the document is the center of everything, dramatic lighting contrast, cinematic, the feeling of an "aha" moment.

**Motion:** Slow zoom into the glowing document

**Text overlay:** "Weeks of engineering → Hours of writing"

**Narration:**
After reading through these plugins, I built a working version in a few hours. One file encoding our recommendation logic — our framework, our standards, our required format. One command to run it. The output: a structured recommendation, ready for advisor review. What I estimated as weeks became hours.

---

## [SCENE 16: The Moat — 7s]

**Video prompt:** Two identical buildings side by side — one generic and plain, the other customized with unique architectural details, glowing windows showing specialized content, the customized building growing taller and more impressive over time, metaphor for compounding institutional knowledge, twilight sky, cinematic.

**Motion:** Slow tilt up following the growing building

**Narration:**
And here's what most people miss. Anyone can install these plugins. The real moat is the firm-specific knowledge you layer on top. Your deal frameworks, your research methodology, your client communication style — all codified and version-controlled. That institutional knowledge, encoded into skill files, is harder to replicate than any software subscription.

---

## [SCENE 17: Adoption Reality — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A traffic light metaphor — three large glowing circles stacked vertically in a dark space. Green at top showing financial reports flowing quickly, yellow in middle showing models going through a review process, red at bottom showing a locked data vault, clean minimal design, soft ambient lighting.

**Motion:** Slow pan down from green to red

**Narration:**
Now, what actually gets adopted in a real firm? Earnings summaries, comp tables, first-draft reports — those move fast. Full models going into client decks — slower, because compliance needs to sign off first. And the real blocker? It's not the AI. It's the data. If your firm doesn't already subscribe to these data providers, you're not unlocking the full power.

---

## [SCENE 18: What To Do Now — 8s]

**Video prompt:** A person standing at a large window overlooking a city skyline at dawn, holding a tablet showing a checklist with glowing checkmarks appearing one by one, reflection in the glass, orange and blue dawn light, contemplative and forward-looking mood, cinematic wide shot.

**Motion:** Slow push-in toward the window

**Narration:**
If you're a product leader in finance, here are three moves. One: audit your data contracts — which of these eleven providers does your firm already pay for? Those are free wins. Two: read the skill files — they represent a well-designed view of how financial workflows should be structured. That's a roadmap. Three: start the compliance conversation now. The technical lift is small. The organizational lift is where the timeline actually lives.

---

## [SCENE 19: The Blueprint — 8s]

**Video prompt:** An architectural blueprint unrolling on a table, but instead of a building it shows the layout of an AI-native firm — modular blocks, data flows, knowledge systems, all interconnected, blueprint style with glowing blue lines on dark background, camera slowly flying over the blueprint, epic scale.

**Motion:** Slow overhead fly-over

**Narration:**
Anthropic didn't just release plugins this week. They released a blueprint for what the AI-native financial firm looks like. Modular. Data-connected. Workflow-specific. Customizable by anyone who understands the domain. The firms encoding their institutional knowledge into this architecture right now are building something that compounds. Not just a productivity tool. An organizational knowledge system.

---

## [SCENE 20: Closing — 6s]

**Video prompt:** A clean modern desk with a laptop showing a finished financial report, camera slowly pulling back to reveal a bright window with morning light, optimistic and forward-looking atmosphere, warm golden tones blending with cool blues, the feeling of a new chapter beginning, cinematic shallow depth of field.

**Motion:** Slow pull-back revealing the sunrise

**Narration:**
The firms that wait for a vendor to package this will pay three times as much for something already a generation behind. We've seen this pattern before. It's playing out again — faster. Follow for more on building AI-native in financial services.

## Production Notes

- **Music:** Ambient electronic with subtle tension building through scenes 1-8 (the setup), transitioning to warm and contemplative for scenes 9-15 (personal experience), resolving to confident and optimistic for scenes 16-20 (call to action). Think Hans Zimmer meets Lo-Fi — sophisticated but accessible.
- **Color grade:** Cool blue-tinted for Wall Street/institutional scenes, warm golden for personal office/experience scenes, blend of both for the conclusion
- **Pacing:** Medium pace overall — slightly slower than news recap to match the essay/explainer tone. Longer holds on scenes 12 and 15 (key insight moments). Quick transitions for the data vendor and market reaction scenes (6-8).
- **Thumbnail concept:** Split image — left side shows Wall Street/financial buildings in cool blue, right side shows a glowing skill file/document in warm gold. Aaron in the center looking at camera. Bold text: "WALL STREET'S AI BLUEPRINT" or "I Ran Anthropic's Finance AI on Real Work"
- **Title options:**

  3. The AI Shift Wall Street Can't Ignore (2026)
  4. Anthropic's Finance Plugins: My Honest Take
- **Description draft:**
  Anthropic released open-source financial services plugins for Claude — covering DCF models, equity research, investment banking, PE, and wealth management, wired to 11 institutional data sources. I build software at a financial firm. I read the entire repo, then ran it on real work. Here's what I actually found — and why the real story isn't the plugins, it's the eleven data vendors that just declared a new standard.
