## Post

I spent 15 years chasing career milestones. Senior Manager by 30. Partner by 35. Hit every target. Still felt stuck.

Then I watched Chamath Palihapitiya compress 30 years of business advice into one idea: stop setting goals, start committing to a process. His 6 rules — on debt, humility, optionality, status — aren't separate tips. They're a system designed to protect continuous learning from the things that interrupt it.

I mapped each rule against my own career and my current AI transition. The framework explains why process-orientation matters more now than ever — when AI shifts the landscape so fast that any fixed goal becomes obsolete before you reach it.
