## [SLIDE: Process Over Goals — cover.png]

I've set goals my entire career. Senior Manager by 30. Ship the product by Q3. Hit the revenue target by year-end. I checked every box.

Then I watched Chamath Palihapitiya explain why goal-orientation is the wrong framework entirely. And I realized: the best periods of my career had no goals at all. They had a process.

## [SLIDE: The Goal Trap — s01-01-milestones-checklist.png]

For fifteen years, I optimized around milestones. Every goal was clear, measurable, motivating. And I hit them.

[IMAGE: s01-02-after-arrival.png]

But here's what nobody prepares you for: the moment after you arrive. A brief rush — a week, maybe two — then emptiness. And the only answer your brain offers is: now what?

[IMAGE: s01-03-arrival-fallacy-cycle.png]

Psychologists call this the "arrival fallacy" — the illusion that reaching a destination will bring lasting happiness. Tal Ben-Shahar discovered it through his own experience as an elite squash player. Every victory brought euphoria that faded almost immediately.

[IMAGE: 01-goal-trap.png]

Goal, achieve, emptiness, new goal, repeat. I lived that cycle for fifteen years.

[IMAGE: s01-05-chamath-never-stop.png]

Then I watched Chamath's "30 Years of Business Advice." His first rule is "Never Stop." But it's not about hustle. It's about committing to the process of learning and risk-taking — not to endpoints. Buffett at 95 isn't chasing a goal. He's running a process.

Chamath compressed 30 years into 6 rules. When you look at them through the lens of process over goals, they form a coherent operating system.

## [SLIDE: The 6 Rules as a System — s02-01-six-nodes-overview.png]

Most summaries of Chamath's video list 6 independent tips. They miss the point. These rules are interconnected — they all protect the same thing: your ability to keep learning.

[IMAGE: s02-02-rule1-never-stop.png]

Rule 1: Never Stop. The foundation. Commit to continuous learning. Not "work 80 hours" — never allow yourself to stop growing. The most stagnant years of my career were when I was executing against a plan instead of learning.

[IMAGE: s02-03-rule2-no-debt.png]

Rule 2: No Debt. Debt forces you into goal-orientation. When you owe, you optimize for short-term payoff, not long-term learning. Financial debt. Technical debt. Same trap.

[IMAGE: s02-04-rule3-humility.png]

Rule 3: Manage with Humility. Be absolutely honest about where you are right now. The hardest part of my AI transition was admitting I was starting from zero. That humility unlocked faster learning than any confidence could have.

[IMAGE: 02-six-rules-system.png]

Rule 4: Surround Yourself with Younger People. They're early warning systems for the future. Junior developers on my team adopted AI faster than anyone. They were my signal that the shift was real.

[IMAGE: s02-06-rule5-optionality.png]

Rule 5: Preserve Optionality. Goals narrow focus. Optionality keeps it wide. I've been building side projects while keeping my day job — not "quitting to go all-in" but building capability and keeping doors open.

[IMAGE: s02-07-rule6-status.png]

Rule 6: Status is Manufactured. Chasing status optimizes for other people's scorecards. Titles felt great for a week. The actual skill-building — coding AI agents, publishing daily — that's what compounds.

## [SLIDE: Why Now — s03-01-ai-acceleration.png]

Process over goals has always been good advice. But there's a reason it's especially critical right now.

AI is accelerating the rate at which the landscape shifts. When the ground moves every six months, goals based on today's assumptions become obsolete before you reach them.

[IMAGE: s03-02-prompt-engineer-obsolete.png]

The person who set a goal to "master prompt engineering" in January 2025 watched agents make that skill less relevant by December. The person who committed to "learning how AI systems work" adapted seamlessly. Process over destination.

[IMAGE: 03-why-now.png]

Chamath references a 1957 experiment by Curt Richter. Rats placed in water — most gave up within 15 minutes. But rats that were rescued once — pulled out, rested, put back — swam for up to 60 hours. Not minutes. Hours. The difference wasn't physical. It was belief.

[IMAGE: s03-04-belief-anchor.png]

For builders navigating AI's uncertainty, the equivalent isn't believing a specific outcome will happen. It's believing in your process — that if you keep learning, you'll find your way. That belief sustains you when everything else is shifting.

## [SLIDE: The Anti-Goal Operating System — s04-01-daily-rituals.png]

Here's what process-orientation looks like in practice.

No 5-year plan. Instead — daily learning rituals. Build something with AI every day.

[IMAGE: s04-02-ship-iterate.png]

No revenue targets. Instead — ship and iterate. Let the market teach me.

No follower goals. Instead — publish consistently, make each piece better than the last.

[IMAGE: s04-03-compound-capabilities.png]

No career destination. Instead — accumulate capabilities that compound.

[IMAGE: 04-anti-goal-os.png]

The paradox: process-orientation often achieves "goals" faster than goal-orientation. When you stop wasting energy on the anxiety gap — the distance between where you are and where you should be — you redirect that energy toward actual work.

James Clear said it: "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." Chamath is saying the same thing from a different angle.

## [SLIDE: The Process Is the Point — s05-01-one-lesson.png]

Chamath's 6 rules aren't 6 separate lessons. They're one lesson: commit to the process of learning. Remove what stops you — debt, status, fixed goals, ego. Stay honest about where you are.

[IMAGE: 05-process-is-the-point.png]

The best career advice I've received recently isn't "set bigger goals" or "hustle harder." It's this: the people who win are the ones who never stop learning. Not because they have a target. Because the process itself is the point.

[IMAGE: s05-03-ai-journey-compounding.png]

My AI transition is living proof. No business plan. No timeline. No revenue target. Just a commitment to building with AI every single day. And somehow, it's producing more results than any goal-oriented plan I've ever written.

If this resonated, subscribe — I share honest takes on building with AI every week. No hype, just what I learn by doing.
