## Title

I Chased Goals for 15 Years. Chamath Showed Me What I Got Wrong.

## Description

```
I set goals my entire career — Senior Manager by 30, Partner by 35, ship by Q3, hit the number. I checked every box. Then I watched Chamath Palihapitiya explain why goal-orientation is the wrong framework entirely.

His 6 rules aren't independent tips. They're an interconnected system that protects one thing: your ability to keep learning. In this video, I break down the "process over goals" framework, map each rule against my own 15-year career, and explain why this matters more now than ever — when AI shifts the landscape so fast that any fixed goal becomes obsolete before you reach it.
