I set goals for 15 years. Hit most of them. Still felt stuck.

Then I watched Chamath explain why goal-orientation is a trap — and I realized the best periods of my career had no goals at all. They had a process. Here's the framework:

For fifteen years I optimized my career around milestones. Senior Manager by 30. Partner by 35. Ship the product. Hit the number. Every management book tells you this is the way. And I checked every box.

But here's what nobody prepares you for: the moment after you arrive. A brief rush — a week, maybe two — then a quiet emptiness. Psychologists call this the "arrival fallacy." The illusion that reaching a destination will bring lasting happiness. It never does.

Then I watched Chamath Palihapitiya's "30 Years of Business Advice" and something clicked. His first rule: "Never Stop." Not hustle culture. Commitment to the PROCESS of learning, not to endpoints. Buffett at 95 isn't chasing a goal. He's running a process.

Here's what most summaries of Chamath's video miss. His 6 rules aren't independent tips. They're an interconnected system that protects one thing: your ability to keep learning.

Rule 1: Never Stop — commit to continuous learning. My most stagnant years were when I was "executing against a plan" instead of learning. Most productive period? The last 6 months. No plan, just building with AI every day.

Rule 2: No Debt — debt forces you into goal-orientation. When you owe, you optimize for short-term payoff, not long-term learning. Same principle with technical debt in product work. Every sprint becomes patching instead of learning.

Rule 3: Manage with Humility — be absolutely honest about where you are. The hardest part of my AI transition: admitting I was starting from zero. That humility unlocked faster learning than any confidence could have.

Rule 4: Surround Yourself with Younger People — they're early warning systems for the future. Junior devs on my team adopted AI faster than anyone. They didn't have 15 years of "the way things are done" to unlearn.

Rule 5: Preserve Optionality — goals narrow focus, optionality keeps it wide. I'm building side projects while keeping my day job. Not "quitting to go all-in" (goal-oriented) but "building capability and keeping doors open" (process-oriented).

Rule 6: Status is Manufactured — chasing status optimizes for other people's scorecards. Titles felt great for a week. The actual skill-building — coding AI agents, publishing daily — has compounded in ways no title ever did.

Why does this matter especially right now? Because AI shifts the landscape every 6 months. Goals based on today's assumptions become obsolete before you reach them. The person who committed to "learning how AI works" adapted seamlessly. The person who set a goal to "master prompt engineering" watched agents make it less relevant.

Process-oriented people don't need to tear up their plan when tech shifts. They were never attached to a specific plan in the first place.

James Clear said it: "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." Chamath is saying the same thing from a different angle. Build systems. Commit to process. Let results compound.

I'm documenting this process — building with AI, learning in public, shipping weekly. Follow along.
