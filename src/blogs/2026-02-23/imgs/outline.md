## Illustration 0 — Cover

**Position**: Top of article (cover image)
**Purpose**: Set the tone — process as an upward spiral vs goals as a linear ladder
**Visual Content**: Split composition: left side shows a rigid ladder with checkmarks at each rung (titles, salary, launch) ending at a question mark; right side shows a flowing upward spiral labeled "learn," "build," "iterate" with no endpoint. Central figure choosing the spiral path.
**Type Application**: Framework — two contrasting mental models
**Filename**: 00-cover.png

## Illustration 1 — The Goal Trap

**Position**: After Section 1 (The Goal Trap)
**Purpose**: Visualize the arrival fallacy cycle
**Visual Content**: Circular loop diagram: Goal → Achieve → Brief Rush → Emptiness → "Now What?" → New Goal → repeat. The loop should feel like a hamster wheel. A small break in the circle suggests escape toward "Process."
**Type Application**: Framework — cyclical system with an exit point
**Filename**: 01-goal-trap.png

## Illustration 2 — The 6 Rules as a System

**Position**: After Section 2 (The 6 Rules as a System)
**Purpose**: Show the 6 rules as interconnected nodes protecting a central concept
**Visual Content**: Hexagonal network diagram with "Continuous Learning" at the center. Six nodes around it: Never Stop, No Debt, Humility, Young People, Optionality, No Status. Connecting lines between nodes show interdependencies. Each node has a subtle icon.
**Type Application**: Framework — interconnected network model

## Illustration 3 — Why Now (AI Era)

**Position**: After Section 3 (Why Process-Orientation Matters More Now)
**Purpose**: Visualize AI acceleration making fixed goals obsolete
**Visual Content**: Timeline showing landscape shifting every 6 months. Goal-oriented path (straight arrow) misses the shifting targets. Process-oriented path (adaptive curve) flows with the changes. Include the rat experiment insight: "15 min vs 60 hours — belief in process = resilience."
**Type Application**: Framework — adaptive vs rigid paths through shifting landscape

## Illustration 4 — The Anti-Goal Operating System

**Position**: After Section 4 (The Anti-Goal Operating System)
**Purpose**: Contrast goal-oriented vs process-oriented operating systems
**Visual Content**: Two-column comparison framework. Left: "Goal OS" — 5-year plan, revenue targets, follower goals, career destination (rigid, anxiety-producing). Right: "Process OS" — daily rituals, ship & iterate, publish consistently, compound capabilities (flowing, compounding). Bottom: James Clear quote as a connecting principle.
**Type Application**: Framework — comparison of two operating systems
**Filename**: 04-anti-goal-os.png

## Illustration 5 — The Process Is the Point

**Position**: End of article (conclusion)
**Purpose**: Closing visual — the compound effect of process-orientation
**Visual Content**: Upward flowing composition showing daily inputs (learn, build, iterate) feeding into a growing spiral of compound capability. No endpoint visible — the spiral continues upward. Subtle text: "The process is the point."
**Type Application**: Framework — compound growth visualization
**Filename**: 05-process-is-the-point.png
