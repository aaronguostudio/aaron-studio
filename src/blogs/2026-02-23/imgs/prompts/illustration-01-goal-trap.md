The Goal Trap — Arrival Fallacy Cycle

STRUCTURE: Circular loop diagram with an exit path

CYCLE (clockwise):
- "Set Goal" (starting point, with target icon)
- → "Achieve" (checkmark icon)
- → "Brief Rush" (small burst/sparkle, quickly fading)
- → "Emptiness" (hollow circle, muted)
- → "Now What?" (question mark, emphasized)
- → back to "Set Goal"

The loop should feel like a hamster wheel — repetitive, going nowhere. Use circular arrows connecting each stage. The cycle itself rendered in Dusty Rose (#D4A5A5) and muted tones.

EXIT PATH:
- A break in the circle between "Now What?" and "Set Goal"
- An alternative arrow pointing outward and upward labeled "Process"
- This exit path rendered in Muted Teal (#5B8A8A) with a warm Gold (#C9A962) glow

LABELS: Each stage labeled clearly. "Arrival Fallacy" as a subtle subtitle below the cycle.
COLORS: Warm Cream background (#F5F0E6). Cycle in Dusty Rose (#D4A5A5) and Soft Coral (#E8A598). Exit path in Muted Teal (#5B8A8A) and Gold (#C9A962). Charcoal (#3D3D3D) for text.
STYLE: Elegant refined illustration. Delicate line work with refined strokes. Subtle icons at each stage. Balanced whitespace. Soft gradients. Professional and sophisticated.
Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered or positioned by content needs.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
ASPECT: 16:9
