The 6 Rules as an Interconnected System — Conceptual Framework

STRUCTURE: Hexagonal network diagram, central hub with six surrounding nodes

CENTER:
- Large central node: "Continuous Learning"
- Rendered as a glowing circle with Gold (#C9A962) accent
- The core that all rules protect

SIX NODES (arranged in hexagonal pattern around center):
1. "Never Stop" — top position, infinity symbol icon
2. "No Debt" — top-right, broken chain icon
3. "Humility" — bottom-right, open hands icon
4. "Young People" — bottom, binoculars/radar icon
5. "Optionality" — bottom-left, branching paths icon
6. "No Status" — top-left, discarded crown icon

CONNECTIONS:
- Each node connects to the center with elegant thin lines
- Adjacent nodes also connect to each other with subtle dashed lines
- Shows interdependency: removing one weakens the system

COLORS: Warm Cream background (#F5F0E6). Center node: Gold (#C9A962). Nodes alternate between Muted Teal (#5B8A8A) and Soft Coral (#E8A598). Connections in Copper (#B87333) with varying opacity. Charcoal (#3D3D3D) for text.
STYLE: Elegant refined illustration. Delicate line work with refined strokes. Subtle icons within each node. Graceful curves for connections. Balanced whitespace around the diagram. Soft drop shadows for depth on nodes. Sophisticated and professional.
Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered or positioned by content needs.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
ASPECT: 16:9
