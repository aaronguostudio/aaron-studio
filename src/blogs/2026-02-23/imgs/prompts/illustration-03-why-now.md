Why Process-Orientation Matters Now — AI Era Shifting Landscape

STRUCTURE: Horizontal landscape with two contrasting paths

LANDSCAPE:
- A terrain that shifts and transforms from left to right (representing time / AI acceleration)
- Subtle wave-like undulations showing the ground is unstable and changing
- Timeline markers at bottom: "6 months," "12 months," "18 months"

PATH 1 — "Goal-Oriented" (top):
- Straight rigid arrow shooting toward a fixed target
- The target keeps moving/dissolving as the landscape shifts
- Arrow ends in a dead end or misses the target
- Rendered in Dusty Rose (#D4A5A5), fading

PATH 2 — "Process-Oriented" (bottom):
- Flowing adaptive curve that bends with the landscape
- Continuously moving forward, adjusting to changes
- No fixed endpoint — the path itself is the journey
- Rendered in Muted Teal (#5B8A8A), vibrant

CALLOUT BOX (bottom-right):
- Small inset: "The Rat Experiment"
- "15 min vs 60 hours"
- "Belief in process = resilience"
- Subtle Gold (#C9A962) border

LABELS: "Fixed goals become obsolete" (near goal path), "Process adapts automatically" (near process path)
COLORS: Warm Cream background (#F5F0E6). Shifting landscape in light Soft Coral (#E8A598) washes. Goal path in Dusty Rose (#D4A5A5). Process path in Muted Teal (#5B8A8A). Callout in Gold (#C9A962). Charcoal (#3D3D3D) for text.
STYLE: Elegant refined illustration. Delicate line work. Subtle gradients showing landscape shifts. Generous whitespace. Professional and sophisticated. Flowing organic curves contrast with rigid straight lines.
Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered or positioned by content needs.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
ASPECT: 16:9
