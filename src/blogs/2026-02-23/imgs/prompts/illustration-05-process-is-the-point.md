The Process Is the Point — Compound Growth

STRUCTURE: Vertical upward-flowing composition showing compound growth

BASE (bottom):
- Daily inputs represented as small seeds or droplets falling into a foundation
- Labels: "Learn," "Build," "Iterate"
- Simple, modest starting point

GROWTH (middle):
- The inputs feed into a growing upward spiral
- Each revolution of the spiral is slightly larger than the last
- Along the spiral, small markers show accumulated capabilities
- The spiral gains momentum and vibrancy as it rises

APEX (top):
- The spiral continues beyond the top edge of the frame — no endpoint
- Suggests infinite continuation
- Radiating subtle warm glow at the top edge
- The message: there is no "arrival" — the spiral IS the point

TEXT:
- "The Process Is the Point" — large, centered, elegant typography
- Positioned in the upper third where the spiral opens up

COLORS: Warm Cream background (#F5F0E6). Base/seeds in Soft Coral (#E8A598). Spiral transitions from Muted Teal (#5B8A8A) at bottom to Gold (#C9A962) at top — showing increasing value. Subtle Copper (#B87333) accents on capability markers. Charcoal (#3D3D3D) for text.
STYLE: Elegant refined illustration. Delicate line work with refined strokes. Graceful flowing curves. Soft gradients showing growth and warmth. Generous whitespace. The overall feel should be aspirational and calm — not frantic or urgent. Sophisticated and professional.
Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered or positioned by content needs.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
