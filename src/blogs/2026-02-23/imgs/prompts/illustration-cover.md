Process Over Goals — Conceptual Framework Cover

STRUCTURE: Split composition, two contrasting mental models side by side

LEFT SIDE — "Goal-Oriented":
- A rigid vertical ladder with labeled rungs: "Title," "Salary," "Launch," "Revenue"
- Each rung has a small checkmark
- Ladder ends at the top with a large question mark
- Muted, faded colors suggesting diminishing returns

RIGHT SIDE — "Process-Oriented":
- A flowing upward spiral, organic and continuous
- Spiral labeled with flowing text: "Learn," "Build," "Iterate," "Adapt"
- No endpoint — spiral continues upward beyond the frame
- Warm, vibrant colors suggesting growth and energy

CENTER:
- A simplified stylized human silhouette at the fork between the two paths
- Figure oriented toward the spiral path
- Subtle glow around the process path

LABELS: "Goals" (left, muted), "Process" (right, prominent)
COLORS: Warm Cream background (#F5F0E6). Left side: Dusty Rose (#D4A5A5), muted tones. Right side: Muted Teal (#5B8A8A) and Gold (#C9A962) for warmth and aspiration. Charcoal (#3D3D3D) for text and outlines.
STYLE: Elegant refined illustration. Delicate line work with refined strokes. Subtle gradients with smooth transitions. Generous whitespace. Thin borders and elegant dividers. Soft drop shadows for depth. No harsh contrasts. Balanced harmonious composition.
Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered or positioned by content needs.
Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.
ASPECT: 16:9
