Thinking about goals? Well, there's a better approach you might want to consider. It's all about the process, and right now... that advice is more relevant than ever.

Imagine someone who decided, in January 2025, that they were going to "master prompt engineering." By December, though, they watched as agents turned that skill into something kinda less important.

Have you ever heard about that wild 1957 experiment by Curt Richter? It’s pretty mind-blowing. So, picture this: he puts rats in water, right? Most of them throw in the towel after just 15 minutes.

It wasn’t about their physical ability. Nope, it was all about belief.

Navigating the uncertainty of AI can feel like trying to find your way in a fog. It's not about putting all your chips on one specific outcome... it’s more about trusting your process. If you keep learning and adapting, you’re bound to find your path eventually. That kind of belief? It’s your lifeline when everything else seems to be in flux.
