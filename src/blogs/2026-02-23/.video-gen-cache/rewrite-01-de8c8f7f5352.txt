Fifteen years, I spent chasing milestones. Each goal was crystal clear, easy to measure, and, honestly, pretty motivating. And you know what? I actually hit them.

You know what’s wild? Nobody really talks about that feeling you get right after you hit a big goal. You’ve got this awesome rush for, I don’t know, a week or maybe two... and then, boom—sudden emptiness. It’s like your brain just throws up its hands and goes, “Okay, now what?”

Ever heard of the "arrival fallacy"? It's this quirky idea that hitting a goal will somehow unlock a treasure chest of happiness. Tal Ben-Shahar learned this the hard way. He was a top-notch squash player and, let me tell you, every win gave him this incredible rush. But guess what? That high didn’t last long at all... it fizzled out almost right away.

You know that feeling where you set a goal, achieve it, and then... just feel empty? Yeah, I lived that for fifteen long years. It was like a never-ending loop: goal, achieve, emptiness, new goal... and then repeat.

I checked out Chamath's "30 Years of Business Advice," and let me tell you — his first rule is a real gem: "Never Stop." But don't get it twisted; it’s not about that relentless hustle culture. Nah, it’s more about committing to the journey of learning and taking risks, rather than just fixating on some finish line. Take Buffett, for example. At 95, he isn’t out there chasing goals. He’s all about running a process.

Chamath really packed a lot of wisdom into just six rules. When you view them through the lens of prioritizing process over goals, you start to see a clear, cohesive operating system emerge. It’s pretty neat!
