I tried to be a consistent blogger for years. Every time: write 2-3 posts, get busy, disappear.

The problem was never ideas. It was the 6 hours of execution per post — writing, formatting, images, translating to Chinese, publishing, social media.

So I stopped trying to write blog posts. I built an AI content studio instead.

Now one rough plan.md (even in mixed Chinese/English) becomes:
→ Blog post
→ Chinese translation
→ 5 custom illustrations
→ X thread
→ LinkedIn post
→ YouTube video
→ Published to my site

The key insight: AI doesn't need to think for you. It needs to handle everything AROUND the thinking.
