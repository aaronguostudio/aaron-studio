## Illustration 0 (Cover)

**Position**: Cover image
**Purpose**: Set the visual tone — a content pipeline transforming a rough idea into multiple polished outputs
**Visual Content**: A minimal pipeline diagram: a messy handwritten note on the left flows through a central "AI Studio" box and fans out into multiple clean output icons (blog, video, social, translation) on the right
**Type Application**: Infographic — clean pipeline visualization
**Filename**: 00-cover.png

## Illustration 1

**Position**: After "The Real Reason I Kept Quitting" intro paragraph
**Purpose**: Visualize the emotional weight of abandoned drafts — the graveyard of started-but-never-published posts
**Visual Content**: A stack of document icons with crossed-out or faded titles, some with dust marks. A small calendar showing months passing. A "Draft 1", "Draft 2", "Draft 3" label on each, with a dotted arrow looping back to the start representing the cycle of starting and stopping
**Type Application**: Infographic — data visualization of the quit cycle
**Filename**: 01-infographic-abandoned-blogs.png

## Illustration 2

**Position**: After the bullet list breaking down the 6-hour cost
**Purpose**: Make the hidden time cost tangible and scannable
**Visual Content**: A horizontal stacked bar or timeline showing 6 segments: Writing (1-2h), Formatting (30m), Images (1h), Translation (1-2h), Publishing (30m), Social (30m). Total: ~6 hours. Each segment labeled with a simple icon. The bar should feel heavy/long to emphasize the burden
**Type Application**: Infographic — time breakdown visualization
**Filename**: 02-infographic-hidden-cost.png

## Illustration 3

**Position**: After "I wanted AI to handle everything around the thinking"
**Purpose**: Clarify the key distinction between thinking (human) and execution (AI)
**Visual Content**: Two-column layout. Left column labeled "Thinking (You)" with items: ideas, angle, personal experience, perspective. Right column labeled "Execution (AI)" with items: writing mechanics, formatting, translation, images, publishing, social. A brain icon on the left, a gear/robot icon on the right. Clear visual separation
**Type Application**: Infographic — comparison/categorization
**Filename**: 03-infographic-thinking-vs-execution.png

## Illustration 4

**Position**: After the 7-step pipeline walkthrough
**Purpose**: Show the full pipeline as a single visual — the core value proposition of the article
**Visual Content**: A left-to-right flow diagram. Starting with a rough "plan.md" document icon, flowing through 7 numbered steps (each as a small node with an icon), fanning out at the end into 8 output icons: blog post, Chinese translation, cover image, 5 illustrations, X thread, LinkedIn post, YouTube script, video. Label "1 input → 8 outputs" prominently
**Type Application**: Infographic — process flow visualization
**Filename**: 04-infographic-content-pipeline.png

## Illustration 5

**Position**: After "Start with the step that kills your momentum"
**Purpose**: Make the actionable takeaway visual — show that you can start by removing just one friction point
**Visual Content**: A chain of 6 linked blocks representing pipeline steps, with one block highlighted/removed and labeled "Start here". The remaining blocks still connect. Small icons on each block (pen, image, translate, publish, share). Message: you don't need to automate everything at once — remove one link of friction
**Type Application**: Infographic — actionable framework
**Filename**: 05-infographic-start-small.png
