AI Content Studio Pipeline - Cover Illustration

Minimalist hand-drawn line art infographic in Notion style. Clean white background (#FFFFFF).

Layout: Horizontal left-to-right flow, centered on canvas.

LEFT SIDE: A single messy handwritten note icon with scribbled lines representing a rough "plan.md" — slightly tilted, with a hand-drawn wobble effect. Label: "One rough idea"

CENTER: A simple rounded rectangle box with a gear icon inside, labeled "AI Studio" in clean hand-drawn lettering. Thin doodle-style arrows flowing from left into this box.

RIGHT SIDE: Multiple clean output icons fanning out from the center box via thin arrows — a document icon (blog), a speech bubble (social), a film frame (video), a globe icon (translation), a picture frame (images). Each small and simple. Label: "8 polished outputs"

COLORS: Black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white. Soft Blue (#A8D4F0) fill on the AI Studio box. Slate Gray (#B0BEC5) for secondary elements and arrows. Sage Green (#B2DFDB) as subtle accent fills on output icons. No other colors.

STYLE: Hand-drawn wobble effect on all lines. Single-weight line work. Maximum whitespace. Simple doodle icons — not detailed. Clean hand-drawn lettering for labels.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered.
