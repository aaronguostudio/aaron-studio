Start Small - Remove One Friction Point

Minimalist hand-drawn line art infographic in Notion style. Clean white background (#FFFFFF).

Layout: Horizontal chain of 6 connected blocks, centered on canvas.

CHAIN BLOCKS (left to right):
1. "Write" — pen icon
2. "Format" — document icon
3. "Images" — picture icon — THIS BLOCK is highlighted: dashed outline, lifted slightly, with a hand-drawn circle around it and a star/sparkle, labeled "Start here!" in hand-drawn text with an arrow pointing to it
4. "Translate" — globe icon
5. "Publish" — rocket icon
6. "Share" — chat bubble icon

CONNECTIONS: Thin hand-drawn lines connecting each block. The highlighted block (Images) shows the connection as broken/removed, with the chain still intact on both sides — illustrating that removing one link makes the whole chain lighter.

BOTTOM TEXT: "You don't need to automate everything. Remove one friction point." in clean hand-drawn lettering.

COLORS: Black outlines (#1A1A1A) on white. Regular blocks in Slate Gray (#B0BEC5) with light fill. Highlighted block in Sage Green (#B2DFDB) with Soft Blue (#A8D4F0) accent for the "Start here" label. No warm colors.

STYLE: Hand-drawn wobble. Simple doodle icons per block. Single-weight lines. Maximum whitespace around the chain.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered.
