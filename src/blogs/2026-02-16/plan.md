# Plan: Day One with My AI Partner

## Core Message
Today I set up OpenClaw on my Mac mini and it changed everything. I now have a personal AI partner named GG who lives on my home server, accessible from anywhere. This is what AI-native actually looks like — not just chatting with AI, but having it woven into your life infrastructure.

## The Dream I Couldn't Execute On
- I've wanted to run a personal blog for a long time
- I'd start, write a few posts, then life gets busy and I stop
- The problem was never ideas — it was the effort of writing, formatting, translating (EN/ZH), creating images, publishing
- Traditional blogging requires too many steps for someone with a full-time job and side projects

## How AI Changed This
- AI removed the friction — I can now go from a rough idea (even a WhatsApp voice note) to a fully published bilingual blog post
- I built an AI content studio (aaron-studio) with skills that generate blogs, images, X threads, and YouTube scripts from a simple plan.md
- The quality is genuinely good — not generic AI slop, but content based on my real experiences and thinking
- I'm finally executing consistently because the barrier to publish went from hours to minutes

## What I Set Up Today (Day One with OpenClaw)

### The Infrastructure
- Installed OpenClaw on a Mac mini as an always-on home server
- Connected it to WhatsApp — I can message my AI partner from my phone, anywhere
- Named my AI partner "GG" (after my daughter Grace Guo)
- Set up Tailscale so I can remote into the Mac mini from my MacBook Pro
- Configured the Mac mini to run headless — no monitor, no keyboard, just humming quietly at home

### What GG Can Do
- Chat with me via WhatsApp or terminal
- Browse the web and read X threads for me
- Help me plan content and draft blog posts
- Research trends and analyze opportunities
- Access my files and projects on the Mac mini

### The "Aha" Moment
- I sent GG a Chinese X thread about people making money with OpenClaw wrapper services
- GG opened a browser, read the full article (which was behind X's login wall), and gave me a detailed analysis in Chinese — including three business directions tailored to my skills
- This is not a chatbot. This is a partner who knows my context, my goals, and can take action

## The Bigger Picture
- We're at the beginning of a new era — having a personal AI that knows you, runs 24/7, and can act on your behalf
- The people who set this up now will have a massive advantage
- It's not about replacing humans — it's about giving yourself superpowers
- My blog is proof: something I couldn't sustain for years is now flowing naturally because AI handles the heavy lifting

## Tone
- Personal, honest, practical
- Not hype — show real screenshots and real workflow
- Bilingual audience (EN primary, ZH translation)
- Speak from experience, not theory
