## Core Angle

McKinsey published a major report on US wealth management in 2035. As someone who leads product at a financial firm AND is building AI-native systems on the side, I have a unique vantage point. This isn't a summary — it's my insider reaction. Where McKinsey is right, where they're conservative, and what they're missing.

**Target audience:** Product leaders, financial professionals, AI builders, and anyone interested in how AI will reshape financial services.

**Hook:** McKinsey says wealth management won't be disrupted by AI until 2035. I'm sitting inside a financial firm right now, and I think they're off by about 5 years.

## Structure

### Opening
McKinsey just dropped a 10-page report on the future of US wealth management. Six themes, five CEO imperatives, a 2035 timeline. It's thoughtful. It's also written by consultants, not by someone who ships product at a financial firm every day. I do — and I'm also building AI-native systems on the side. Here's my take.

### Section 1: The Report in 60 Seconds
Quick summary of McKinsey's six themes (keep it brief — readers can go read the full report):
1. Demographic shift — $22T wealth transfer, 40% controlled by women, 100K advisor shortfall
2. Agentic AI — from task automation to autonomous systems
3. Asset class expansion — private, real, digital assets
4. Trust rebuilt through transparency, not reputation
5. Every client becomes a family office
6. Advisors evolve from planners to life coaches

Plus four competitive archetypes: mega-platforms, boutiques, independent platforms, AI-native firms.

### Section 2: Where McKinsey Is Right
**The advisor shortage is real and urgent.**
- I see this in my own firm. Experienced advisors retiring, junior hires taking years to ramp up.
- The math doesn't work without AI augmentation. Period.
- McKinsey's "100,000 advisor shortfall" number feels conservative based on what I'm seeing.

**Trust IS shifting, especially with younger clients.**
- 76% of Gen Z seeking financial advice online — this matches what we see in our product data.
- The "show me, don't tell me" dynamic is real. Younger clients want transparency, not prestige.

**The "family office for everyone" trend is happening.**
- Clients increasingly want holistic advice — not just investments, but tax, estate, insurance, lifestyle.
- Technology is making this possible at lower wealth tiers. We're building toward this.

### Section 3: Where McKinsey Is Too Conservative
**Agentic AI is not a 2035 story — it's happening NOW.**
- I literally set up an AI agent on a Mac mini this week. It runs 24/7, does research, manages my content pipeline, runs scheduled tasks.
- In my day job, we're already using AI to augment product workflows, analyst research, and client reporting.
- McKinsey frames AI agents as a "2035 scenario." Builders are deploying them today. The gap between consultants' timelines and builders' reality is about 5 years.
- 62% of advisors "intend to use AI" — that's 2024 data. By 2026, the ones who haven't started are already behind.

**The four archetypes are missing the most disruptive one.**
- McKinsey identifies "AI-native digital wealth managers" as one of four archetypes. But they underestimate how fast this category will cannibalize the others.
- When a single advisor + AI agents can do what a team of 10 did before (McKinsey's own "firm of one" concept), the economics of every other model break.
- The real disruption isn't a new category — it's AI-native capabilities eating into every category.

**They underplay the speed of portfolio transformation.**
- Tokenization, direct indexing, and digital assets aren't 2035 features — they're 2026 products being shipped right now.
- The "unified managed household" concept they describe as future-state? Early versions exist today.

### Section 4: What McKinsey Is Missing
**The builder vs. buyer divide.**
- The biggest gap in wealth management won't be between firm types — it'll be between firms that BUILD AI capabilities vs. firms that BUY them.
- Firms that treat AI as a vendor solution will always be a generation behind firms that embed AI into their product DNA.
- This is the same pattern we saw with digital: firms that "bought digital" (hired agencies, bought platforms) lost to firms that "became digital."

**The talent crisis isn't just advisors — it's product and engineering.**
- McKinsey focuses on advisor shortage. But who builds the AI systems? The real bottleneck is product leaders and engineers who understand BOTH finance AND AI.
- This intersection is incredibly rare. Most AI engineers don't understand financial services. Most financial professionals don't understand AI architecture.
- The firms that win will be the ones that cultivate this hybrid talent — or partner with people who have it.

**Client experience will leapfrog, not evolve gradually.**
- McKinsey describes a gradual evolution from "clicks to conversations." I think it'll be more abrupt.
- When a client can talk to an AI that knows their entire financial picture, tax situation, and life goals — and get instant, personalized answers — the bar for human advisors jumps overnight.
- This isn't incremental improvement. It's a phase change.

### Section 5: What This Means If You're in the Industry
- **If you're a financial advisor:** Start learning AI tools NOW. Not in 2035. The advisors who thrive will be the ones who augment themselves with AI, not the ones who wait for their firm to hand them tools.
- **If you're a product leader at a financial firm:** Push for building, not buying. Every year you wait to build internal AI capability is a year your competitors get ahead.
- **If you're a builder/engineer:** The financial services AI space is massively under-served. The intersection of finance + AI + product thinking is where the biggest opportunities are.
- **If you're a client:** Demand more from your wealth manager. Ask them how they're using AI. If the answer is "we're exploring it," consider that a red flag.

### Closing
McKinsey's report is a solid map of where the industry is heading. But maps drawn by consultants tend to underestimate the speed of change that builders see on the ground. The firms that treat 2035 as a planning horizon will be disrupted by firms that are building for 2026.

I'm in both worlds — leading product at a financial firm by day, building AI-native systems by night. The future McKinsey describes isn't coming in 10 years. It's coming in 3. The question isn't whether you'll adapt — it's whether you'll lead or follow.
