  "videoPrompt": "Scene 1: A young woman stands at a cliff's edge, ocean waves crashing below, her silhouette outlined by a rising full moon. Scene 2: Flashback to the woman walking through a dense, moonlit forest, her hand brushing against glowing flowers. Scene 3: She finds an old lantern, lights it, and watches as it illuminates a path of shimmering stones. Scene 4: The woman walks confidently down the glowing path towards the horizon, the moon reflecting off the water. Color palette: midnight blue, silver, and soft purple. Photorealistic, with a sense of wonder and discovery.",
