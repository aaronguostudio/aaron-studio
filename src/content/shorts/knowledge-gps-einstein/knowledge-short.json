  "title": "GPS Needs Einstein 🛰️",
  "narration": "Your phone's GPS only works because of Einstein. Satellites move so fast their clocks drift thirty eight microseconds every day. Sounds tiny? Without correction, your location would shift ten kilometers daily. Every time you open Google Maps, you're using a theory from nineteen fifteen. Einstein didn't just change physics. He changed your commute.",
  "videoPrompt": "Scene 1: A GPS satellite orbiting Earth, showing its path. Scene 2: Einstein's face appears in a swirling galaxy, symbolizing relativity. Scene 3: A digital map zooms out from a street view, highlighting precision. End with a starry night sky. Photorealistic, with a deep blue and silver color palette.",
