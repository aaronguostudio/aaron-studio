Quick cut to her laughing with friends, running through a field, each step lifting dust into golden sunlight. 3. Aerial shot of them reaching a cliff, sunset in the background, the sky painted in vibrant hues of orange and pink. 4. Pull-back to reveal them standing hand in hand at the edge, taking in the vast, colorful horizon, symbolizing limitless possibilities. Color palette: Warm sunset tones, golden yellows, deep oranges. Photorealistic. Uplifting and joyous.",
