  "videoPrompt": "Scene 1: A young couple stands on a cliff overlooking the ocean at sunset, their silhouettes framed by the setting sun, holding hands. Scene 2: Flashback to the same couple in a bustling city, laughing and chasing each other through crowded streets at night. Scene 3: In a cozy dimly-lit room, the couple sits together, surrounded by old photographs, looking both happy and melancholic. Scene 4: Back to the cliff, the couple releases a handful of colorful balloons into the sky, symbolizing letting go and moving forward. End with a warm color palette of oranges, blues, and purples. Photorealistic, reflective mood.",
