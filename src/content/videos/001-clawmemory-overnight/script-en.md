# Video 001 — I Told My AI Agent to Build Features While I Slept

**Duration:** ~3-4 min (Build Log style)
**Language:** English
**Target:** X/Twitter + YouTube

---

## [HOOK] 0:00 - 0:15
**画面：** 手机闹钟响 → 打开电脑 → 终端显示 5 个 git commits

> Last night before bed, I gave my AI agent one instruction:
> "Build these 5 features. I'll check tomorrow."
>
> I woke up to this.

**画面：** 快速闪过 5 个 feature 页面

## [CONTEXT] 0:15 - 0:50
**画面：** OpenClaw logo → ClawMemory UI → memory 文件结构

> I'm building ClawMemory — an open-source memory manager for AI agents.
>
> Here's the problem: AI agents like Claude store everything in plain markdown files. That works great — until your agent has hundreds of memories and you have no idea what it knows about you.
>
> So I built a UI for it. Day one, I had the basics — browse files, edit, search.
>
> But I wanted more. And I didn't want to spend my evening coding.

## [SECTION 1 — The Prompt] 0:50 - 1:30
**画面：** 屏幕录制 WhatsApp 对话，展示你发给 GG 的任务

> At 10 PM, I sent my agent this message. Five features:
>
> A health dashboard with activity heatmaps.
> A knowledge graph that visualizes how people, projects, and decisions connect.
> Semantic search — not just keyword matching, but understanding meaning.
> Memory templates for quick capture.
> And smart tag filters.
>
> Then I went to sleep.

**画面：** 关灯，时钟加速从 10 PM → 6 AM

## [SECTION 2 — The Result] 1:30 - 2:45
**画面：** 逐个演示每个 feature，屏幕录制真实产品

> Six hours later. Let me show you what it built.

**Dashboard:**
> Health dashboard — total files, chunks indexed, a GitHub-style heatmap showing which days have memories. It even flags stale memories you haven't updated in 30 days.

**画面：** 鼠标操作 dashboard

**Graph:**
> Knowledge graph — every entity my agent knows about, connected. People, projects, tools. Click a node, see every memory that mentions it.

**画面：** 鼠标点击节点，侧边栏弹出

**Search:**
> Search — toggle between full-text and semantic. Ask "what does Aaron care about" and it actually understands the question.

**画面：** 搜索演示

**Templates + Tags:**
> One-click templates for daily notes, project notes. Auto-extracted tags across all files. Filter instantly.

**画面：** 快速演示

> Five features. Five clean git commits. Build passing. All done while I was asleep.

## [SECTION 3 — The Bigger Picture] 2:45 - 3:30
**画面：** 你本人出镜 或 文字动画

> Here's what I think people get wrong about AI agents.
>
> It's not about asking it to write one function. It's about trusting it with a mission.
>
> I didn't say "write a React component." I said "here's what the product needs, figure it out."
>
> That's the shift. You stop being a coder. You start being a builder.
>
> And the craziest part? This is February 2026. The models are only getting better. Six months from now, I probably won't even need to describe the features. The agent will look at user feedback and propose them itself.

## [CTA] 3:30 - 3:50
**画面：** ClawMemory UI + GitHub 链接

> ClawMemory is open source. Link in the description.
>
> If you're running an AI agent and want a better way to see what it remembers — try it.
>
> And if you're not running an AI agent yet... what are you waiting for?
