# AI-Native Life Progress

The last weekend until now, I have been exploring the AI-Native life. Now I can almost writing blog using my agent system.

## Product Driven Approach

- I think my current blog workflow is still not that optimize, the blog content is a little verbose, long but lack of sharp ideas. Also it's not fully streamlined which I should spend more time to improve.

- To me, Product driven is the approach, instead of working on hype or do advertizing, I rather building great product first. For example this blog system, I want to dig into it, put thinknig there, product great content, that's a lot of work I can do.

## Will AI replace human?

I am not sure, I see a lot of potentials from the agents, but so far, I am not seeing it will replace me, at least I need to build a system which is good enough before it fully automate myself. But if I have a system likes this, I am the owner of this, so it's probably a good thing.
