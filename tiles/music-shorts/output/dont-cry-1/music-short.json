  "videoPrompt": "1. Scene 1: A young woman sitting alone on a deserted beach at dusk, waves gently crashing onto the shore, her face a mixture of sadness and hope as she gazes at the horizon. 2. Scene 2: Flashback to the same woman with a partner laughing and dancing barefoot in the sand during a sunny day, full of joy and love. 3. Scene 3: The couple standing under a pier during sunset, the light filtering through, capturing a moment of deep connection as they hold hands, looking into each other’s eyes. 4. Scene 4: Back to the present, the woman stands up, takes a deep breath, and walks towards the ocean, leaving footprints in the sand, signifying moving forward. Color palette: warm sunset hues, soft blues and golden tones. Photorealistic + emotional, reflective mood.",
