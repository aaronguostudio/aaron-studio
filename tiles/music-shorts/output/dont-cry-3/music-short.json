  "videoPrompt": "Scene 1: A middle-aged man sits on a park bench, staring at a faded photograph with tears in his eyes, a gentle breeze rustling the autumn leaves around him. Scene 2: Flashback to a vibrant summer day, the man and a woman laughing together in a sunlit meadow, capturing their joy and connection. Scene 3: Transition to the man standing alone in the meadow, the colors muted, as he closes his eyes and tilts his head towards the sky, seeking solace. Scene 4: Payoff moment with the sun breaking through the clouds, casting a warm glow over him, symbolizing healing and acceptance. Soft warm colors with hints of gold and autumnal hues. Photorealistic. Emotional, contemplative mood.",
