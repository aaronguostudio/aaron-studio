# Guided demo style

How to write a walk so the rendered video guides the eye, and how to check it. Read this before you write or change a walk, and before you deliver a walkthrough.

The renderer draws every effect below. Never build your own composition, overlay or re-timing for a capture. If an effect is missing, add it to the renderer (`aaron-video-gen/remotion/src/projects/walkthrough-video`) so every agent and every video gets it.

## What the viewer sees

Each step makes one point: its caption, and its line when narrated. The screen shows that point while it is said.

| Step | On screen | What the walk records |
|---|---|---|
| Clicks a control | The pointer glides onto the control. An amber outline draws itself around it. The video holds while the caption is read or the line is spoken. Then the click plays, with a ripple. | Nothing extra: `rec.click` logs the control's box. |
| Shows something (a card, a row, a total, a filter) | An amber outline draws itself around the region. The pointer parks beside it. The video holds on the step's last frame. | A `focus` on that region (below). |
| Waits for the app | Fast-forwarded behind a speed badge. | A `'wait'` step that ends on the finished screen. |

A step either shows or clicks, never both, so a link that opens records takes four steps:

1. **Show** the number on the source page: a focus on it.
2. **Click** the link.
3. **Wait** while the page loads.
4. **Show** the same evidence on the result page: a focus on it, with a caption that says what matches, for example "Seven pending, as on the dashboard".

The walk format (`rec.step`, `rec.click`, where walks live, what runs before the first step) belongs to the project's capture tool: see its `--help` or its own docs.

## Recording a focus

A step's `focus` lists `{ box: { x, y, w, h }, fromMs, toMs }`: viewport CSS px and capture-clock ms, inside the step. The contract is in `aaron-video-gen/references/walkthrough-capture.md`.

Use the recorder's own focus helper if it has one. Otherwise, add this helper to the project's walks. The recorders keep the current step as `rec.current` and the clock as `rec.ms()`, and save each step as it is.

```js
// Outline `locator` for `holdMs`; the renderer draws the box while the recording shows it.
// holdMs only needs to show the outline drawing on: the renderer holds the step for its caption or line.
export async function focus(page, rec, locator, holdMs = 1200) {
  await locator.evaluate((el) => el.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' }))
  let last = null
  for (let i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
    // Measure only once a smooth scroll has stopped moving the box.
    await page.waitForTimeout(50)
    const b = await locator.boundingBox()
    if (b && last && Math.abs(b.y - last.y) < 0.5) break
    last = b
  }
  const b = await locator.boundingBox()
  if (!b) throw new Error('The focus target is not visible')
  const fromMs = rec.ms()
  await page.waitForTimeout(holdMs)
  ;(rec.current.focus ??= []).push({ box: { x: b.x, y: b.y, w: b.width, h: b.height }, fromMs, toMs: rec.ms() })
}
```

Call it last in a step, so the focus lasts until the step ends and stays up through the hold.

- **Outline the evidence the caption names:** the count, the total, the row, the filter chip. An outline around a whole page or table says nothing.
- **Include the evidence's whole element:** its badge and its number, not only the label. The pointer parks just outside the box, so a badge left outside it gets covered. A text locator finds the innermost span. Locate the row, card or pill that holds the text instead, by its test id or role, or with `.locator('..')`.
- **Use one focus per step.** For two numbers that should match, use two steps: one on each screen.
- **End every showing step on a result page with a focus.** Otherwise the pointer stays where the last click left it, which on the new page can be over a row's buttons.

## Pacing

- **Narrated:** the voice nearly fills the video, with one or two sentences per step. The renderer holds each step for its line plus 0.4 s, so a walk needs no long waits of its own.
- **Silent:** each step stays up for its caption's reading time.
- **Length:** one topic per walk, about 1–3 minutes. To get one file, join rendered walks; each walk is one chapter.

## A held frame must be worth holding

The renderer holds a clicking step just before its click, and a showing step on its last frame. Make those frames finished:

- **Before a click:** the control is visible and settled. No spinner, skeleton or toast covers it.
- **At the end of a showing step:** the data has loaded. Never end on a blank page, a "Loading…" splash, skeleton rows, an "Empty" placeholder that is still loading, or an error. Wait for the app's finished signal in a `'wait'` step before it.
  - Check first that the new page is showing (its heading or badge), then that its rows have appeared, then that the progress bar is gone. Before the new page renders, "no progress bar" is already true.
  - When a caption states a number, have the walk read it from the page and fail if it differs.
- **The pointer:** it rests only on the control being clicked or beside the evidence. It never rests on or next to a destructive control (Reject, Delete, Approve), and never over the text being read.
- **Captions:** each claims only what its frame shows, in plain words under about 8. When a caption says two figures match, both are outlined, one on each screen.

## Check before delivering

Render with `--stills` and look at every file in `stills/`, one per step at its hold. Then watch the last second of each wait. Look for:

- a held loading, blank, skeleton or error frame;
- an outline that misses its target or circles the whole page;
- a caption the frame does not prove;
- the pointer covering the evidence or resting near a destructive control;
- data the reader should not see.

Fix the walk and record again. Never patch or cut the video to hide a problem.
