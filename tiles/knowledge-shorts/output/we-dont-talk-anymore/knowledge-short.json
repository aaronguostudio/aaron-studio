  "narration": "Did you know that the feeling of missing someone can trigger the same brain regions as physical pain? When someone who was once our everything is gone, it leaves an emotional gap that's hard to fill. Cherish every moment, because memories are all we have.",
  "videoPrompt": "Cinematic vertical video, melancholic and beautiful. Slow dolly shot through an empty sunlit apartment, golden hour light streaming through sheer curtains onto an unmade bed. A cup of coffee sits cold on a windowsill, steam long gone. Camera slowly pans past a bookshelf with photos turned face down, a wilted flower in a vase, an empty chair by the window. Dust particles floating in warm amber sunbeams. The space feels lived-in but lonely, as if someone just left. Soft shallow depth of field, warm muted tones — honey gold, dusty rose, faded cream. Through the window, a city skyline at golden hour. The mood is bittersweet nostalgia, beautiful sadness. Photorealistic, cinematic film grain, 9:16 vertical, emotional indie film aesthetic.",
