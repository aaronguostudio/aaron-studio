# Home Decor Shorts — Xin's Channel (@cozycozythings)

Generate 15-second vertical YouTube Shorts showcasing beautiful home interiors for **@cozycozythings**.

## Channel Info
- **Channel:** @cozycozythings (Xin — Aaron's wife)
- **Audience:** English-speaking, home decor enthusiasts
- **Content type:** Ambiance videos — Xin adds her own voiceover
- **Output:** Video only (no TTS, no captions) — synced to iCloud for Aaron to send to Xin
- **Trigger phrases:** "给我老婆生成视频" / "Xin的视频" / "home decor short"

## 🎨 Visual Style DNA (from 17 小红书 Reference Photos)

All videos MUST match this specific aesthetic. This is THE look:

### Core Style: Modern European Farmhouse × Quiet Luxury
A blend of:
- **Old World European charm** — arched windows, plaster walls, wainscoting, marble fireplace
- **Modern farmhouse warmth** — shaker cabinets, exposed wood beams, iron fixtures
- **California organic contemporary** — curved furniture, natural materials, indoor-outdoor flow

### Color Palette (STRICT)
- **Walls/ceiling:** Warm white, cream, ivory — NEVER stark/cool white
- **Wood tones:** Honey oak, light pine, warm walnut — visible grain, natural knots
- **Flooring:** Light wide-plank hardwood OR warm limestone/natural stone
- **Metal accents:** Brushed brass, antique gold, oil-rubbed bronze, matte black iron
- **Textile accent:** Navy blue (throw pillows, occasional rug) — the ONE bold color
- **Soft accents:** Sage green, cream, oatmeal, taupe
- **NEVER:** Cool gray, stark white, neon, industrial concrete, dark/moody

### Lighting (Critical — this makes or breaks the video)
- **Golden hour natural light is THE hero** — sunlight streaming through large windows
- Dappled light patterns on hardwood floors from trees outside
- Warm, soft, inviting — NEVER harsh, cool, or artificial-looking
- Dust particles floating in sunbeams
- Supplementary: brass sconces, woven rattan pendants, black iron chandeliers

### Architecture (Key Elements from References)
- **Arched windows/doors** with black steel-framed mullions — signature element
- **French doors** opening to patios/gardens/balconies
- **Exposed wood ceiling beams** (chunky, natural pine/oak)
- **Tongue-and-groove wood plank ceilings** in kitchen zones
- **Wainscoting / wall paneling** with elegant moulding profiles
- **High/vaulted ceilings** — double-height in great rooms
- **White marble fireplace** with classic mantel
- **Built-in bookshelves** in warm oak flanking fireplaces
- **Open floor plans** with room-to-room sightlines through archways

### Furniture (Specific Pieces from References)
- **Cream/ivory bouclé curved sofa** (kidney-shaped) with navy pillows
- **Cream slipcovered deep sofas** — relaxed, lived-in
- **Round/sculptural barrel accent chairs** in cream fabric
- **Natural wood dining tables** — rustic grain, honey-toned, farmhouse scale
- **French-style upholstered bar stools** (curved wood + linen)
- **Mid-century dining chairs** — cream upholstered with slim wood legs
- **Tulip pedestal tables** (Saarinen style) — white, round
- **Bentwood cane-back chairs** (Thonet style) — natural wood + rattan
- **Round wood coffee tables** — chunky pedestal base
- **Rattan/woven baskets**, vintage leather trunks
- **Industrial open shelving** — reclaimed wood + black metal frame

### Decor & Accessories
- **Fresh flowers ALWAYS** — white dahlias, tulips, cherry blossoms, peonies, hydrangeas, magnolia
- **Large glass vases** with olive/eucalyptus branches
- **Curated ceramics** in muted earth tones — terracotta, cream, gray
- **Stacked coffee table books**
- **Vintage Persian or jute rugs** in muted faded tones
- **Linen/sheer curtains** in natural cream — floor length, gently moving
- **Tall indoor olive trees** or fig trees in weathered pots

## 📅 7-Day Room Rotation

每天一个不同房间，7天一循环。每天变换运镜和视角：

| Day | Room | Camera Movement | Key Elements |
|-----|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Day 1** (Mon) | 客厅 Living Room | Slow dolly forward through archway | Bouclé curved sofa, marble fireplace, built-in bookshelves, arched windows, olive tree, navy pillows |
| **Day 2** (Tue) | 厨房+餐厅 Kitchen-Dining | Lateral tracking: island → dining table | Shaker cabinets, marble countertop, brass faucet, wood ceiling beams, farm table, pendant lights |
| **Day 3** (Wed) | 书房 Study / Library | Slow push-in to desk detail | Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, walnut desk, arched window, leather chair, brass lamp, Persian rug |
| **Day 4** (Thu) | 主卧+阳台 Bedroom → Balcony | Drift from bed toward open French doors | Linen bedding, sheer curtains billowing, peonies, morning light, wrought iron balcony, potted plants |
| **Day 5** (Fri) | 娱乐客厅 Great Room | Slow orbit around seating area | Deep slipcovered sofa, double-height ceiling, exposed beams, kitchen island visible, mezzanine |
| **Day 6** (Sat) | 客厅+餐厅 Open Living-Dining | Walk-through from living → dining | Archway transition, curved sofa → farm table, continuous golden light, flowers on both tables |
| **Day 7** (Sun) | 门厅+花园 Entry → Garden | Pull-back from console → out front door to garden | Sage green door, magnolia in vase, gilt mirror, stone path, boxwood hedges, morning light |

## 🎬 Camera Movement Rules

**EVERY video MUST have visible, smooth camera movement. NEVER static.**

| Movement | When to Use |
|----------|------------|
| **Dolly forward** — glide into room through doorway/arch | Day 1: reveals, grand entrances |
| **Lateral track** — slide along a scene left-to-right | Day 2: kitchens, long spaces |
| **Push-in** — gentle zoom toward focal point | Day 3: intimate details, desk/nook |
| **Drift** — float from interior toward open doors/windows | Day 4: bedroom → balcony transition |
| **Orbit/arc** — camera arcs around central furniture | Day 5: showcasing room layouts |
| **Walk-through** — continuous from one room to next | Day 6: open floor plans |
| **Pull-back reveal** — start on detail, pull back for full scene | Day 7: detail → room → outdoors |

### Rules:
- **One movement per video** — don't mix
- **Slow and smooth** — luxury = slow. Never fast/jerky
- **Start or end on a detail** — flowers, light on floor, texture close-up
- **Never repeat same movement two days in a row**

## 🌸 Seasonal Variation

Same room rotation, different seasonal touches for freshness:

| Season | Flowers | Atmosphere | Extras |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Spring** | Cherry blossom, tulips, peonies | Bright morning light, open windows | Garden views, butterflies |
| **Summer** | Sunflowers, lavender, wildflowers | Strong golden hour, blue sky | Iced drinks, linen everything |
| **Autumn** | Dried eucalyptus, orange roses, wheat | Warm amber light, fireplace lit | Wool throws, candles |
| **Winter** | White roses, pine, magnolia | Soft candlelight + snow | Layered textiles, hot cocoa |

## Pipeline

1. **Check day of week** → Pick room from rotation
2. **Build prompt** using room template + style DNA + seasonal variation
3. **Generate Kling video ONLY** — `Kling v3` (15s, 9:16, pro, multi_shot)
4. **Copy RAW kling-video.mp4 to iCloud** — NOT the Remotion-rendered short-final.mp4
5. **Report to Aaron** — video description, suggested title/hashtags, voiceover talking points for Xin

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Raw Video Only!

Xin's videos need the **raw Kling video** (`kling-video.mp4`) — NO title overlay, NO captions, NO audio.
She adds her own voiceover and edits herself.

**DO NOT** use `short-final.mp4` — that has Remotion overlays.
**DO** use `kling-video.mp4` — the pure AI-generated video.

After generation, manually copy the raw video to iCloud:
```bash
cp [output-dir]/kling-video.mp4 \
  "/Users/aaron/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Aaron-Studio/shorts-ready/xin-[slug].mp4"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/aaron/Work/aaron-studio && npx -y bun tiles/knowledge-shorts/scripts/generate.ts \
  --topic "[room concept]" \
  --skip-tts \
  --skip-video=false \
  --video-prompt "[full kling prompt]" \
  --output tiles/home-decor-shorts/output/[slug]/
```

Then copy raw video to iCloud:
```bash
cp tiles/home-decor-shorts/output/[slug]/kling-video.mp4 \
  "/Users/aaron/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Aaron-Studio/shorts-ready/xin-[slug].mp4"
```

Note: The script still runs Remotion render, but we IGNORE `short-final.mp4` and only use `kling-video.mp4`.
