  "videoPrompt": "Cinematic vertical video, slow gentle dolly forward through open French doors into a warm transitional living room. Cream bouclé curved sofa with navy blue accent pillows, round natural oak coffee table with stacked design books and ceramic vase. Large arched windows with sheer linen curtains, golden hour afternoon sunlight streaming in casting warm dappled shadows across light oak hardwood floors. Fresh white peonies in a textured ceramic vase on a walnut console table. Marble fireplace mantel with antique gold mirror above. Built-in oak bookshelves flanking the fireplace with curated ceramics, books, and small potted olive tree. Soft dust particles floating in sunbeams, gentle breeze barely moving the curtains. Color palette: warm cream, ivory, natural oak, touches of navy blue and brass. Photorealistic, interior design photography style, 9:16 vertical, aspirational home magazine aesthetic, warm and inviting atmosphere.",
