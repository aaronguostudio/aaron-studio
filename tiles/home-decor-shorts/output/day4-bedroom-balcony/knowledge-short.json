  "videoPrompt": "Cinematic vertical video, camera slowly drifts from inside a serene master bedroom toward open French doors revealing a sunlit balcony. Interior: linen-upholstered king bed in warm cream with layered oatmeal and white bedding, textured wool throw draped casually. Weathered oak nightstand with a glass vase of fresh pink peonies and a brass reading lamp. Wainscoting panels on walls painted warm ivory. Woven rattan pendant light hanging from the ceiling. Sheer cream linen curtains billowing gently in a warm breeze as the camera drifts toward the open black-framed French doors. The balcony beyond: wrought iron railing, two potted olive trees in terracotta planters, a small bistro table with a steaming coffee cup. Golden morning sunlight pouring through the doors, illuminating floating dust particles. Dappled leaf shadows dancing on the light wide-plank oak hardwood floor. Color palette: warm cream, ivory, natural linen, honey oak, sage green, brass accents. Photorealistic, interior design photography style, 9:16 vertical, aspirational home magazine aesthetic. Smooth continuous camera motion, cinematic depth of field, warm golden color grading.",
