# X Growth — AI-Native Personal Brand

Grow Aaron's X presence by combining authentic build-in-public storytelling with strategic engagement.

## Aaron's Unique Angle

- Senior engineering manager & partner at a financial firm
- Building an AI-native lifestyle (OpenClaw, automated content pipelines, AI agents)
- CEO of OrgNext (AI-native company management)
- Runs a fully automated YouTube Shorts pipeline (Kling + ElevenLabs + Remotion)
- Dad, drummer, builder

**This combination is rare on X.** Most AI accounts are either pure tech or pure hustle. Aaron is a practitioner with real stakes.

## Content Pillars (rotate through these)

### 1. 🔨 Build in Public (40%)
What you're actually building, real numbers, real failures.
- AI shorts pipeline updates ("My agent made 6 videos while I slept")
- OpenClaw daily life moments
- OrgNext progress
- Tool chain decisions

### 2. 💡 AI-Native Takes (30%)
Opinionated perspectives from someone living it, not theorizing.
- Hot takes on AI news (don't summarize — react)
- "Here's what actually happens when you..." stories
- Counter-narrative to AI hype or AI doom

### 3. 🎯 Knowledge Nuggets (20%)
Repurpose knowledge shorts as native X content.
- Turn video scripts into punchy tweets
- Share the video with a hook tweet
- "Did you know..." format works great

### 4. 🤝 Community (10%)
Engage with others, amplify, connect.
- Reply to AI/indie hacker accounts with real insight
- Quote-tweet with added value
- Repost with commentary

## Tweet Style Guide

Based on Aaron's preferences:
- **短、有力、留钩子** — 每条最多 6-8 行
- 一个核心 hook（一句话让人记住）
- 砍掉所有解释性文字，让人自己好奇
- 留悬念 > 说完整
- 不要过度描述功能细节，用关键词列表代替
- 风格参考："You sleep, your agent ships."
- 中英混发 — 英文主打内容，中文做社区互动

### Hook Patterns That Work
- "I let my AI agent [do something crazy]. Here's what happened."
- "Everyone's talking about [trend]. Nobody's mentioning [insight]."
- "[Surprising number/fact]. Let that sink in."
- "Stop [common advice]. Do [contrarian take] instead."
- "Day [N] of [challenge/experiment]: [update]"

### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
- ❌ "Great thread! 🧵" energy
- ❌ Generic motivational quotes
- ❌ Summarizing news without a take
- ❌ "I'm excited to announce..." corporate tone
- ❌ Too many hashtags (max 2-3, at the end)
- ❌ Direct links in tweet body (kills reach — put in reply or bio)

## Daily Routine

### Posting (15 min)
1. One original tweet per day minimum
2. Attach media when possible (video, screenshot, image)
3. Best posting times: 8-9 AM MST or 6-7 PM MST

### Strategic Commenting (15 min)
- Find 3-5 relevant posts from target accounts (see below)
- Leave **substantive** comments with real insight from experience
- NOT "Great point!" — instead share a specific example, counter-argument, or extension
- Comment within 30 min of post going live for max visibility

### Target Accounts to Engage With
Accounts whose audiences overlap with Aaron's positioning:
- AI builders: @levelsio, @nutlope, @mcaborern
- Indie hackers: @marckohlbrugge, @tdinh_me
- AI takes: @emaborossier, @swyx, @karpathy
- Build in public: @dannypostmaa, @marc_louvion
- Update this list as you discover relevant accounts

## Content Generation

### From Knowledge Shorts
When a knowledge short is produced, also generate a tweet:
```
[Hook line from the video]

[1-2 sentence expansion]

[Video attached]

#shorts #ai (or relevant tags)
```

### From Daily Life / Hints
When Aaron shares something from his day, find the X-worthy angle:
- "My colleague went to Tulum" → thread about Maya trading + modern finance parallels
- "Had a frustrating bug" → relatable dev tweet with lesson
- "Grace said something funny" → humanizing dad moment

### Thread Format (for longer stories)
- Tweet 1: Hook (the most surprising/interesting part FIRST)
- Tweet 2-4: Story/evidence (keep each tweet self-contained)
- Tweet 5: Punchline or call-to-action
- Each tweet should work standalone if someone only sees that one

## Metrics to Track

2. Worst performing — what to avoid?
3. Follower growth trend
